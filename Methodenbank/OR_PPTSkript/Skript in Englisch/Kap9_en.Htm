<h2>Linear optimisation with LP5000</h2>

<p><b>Examples for application at Nordland Papier GmbH, Dörpen (Ems)</b></p>

<p class="block">At Nordland Papier GmbH, applying modern scientific
methods to complex management and decision problems is very advanced.
Particularly in areas regarding economy and production, operational
research methods have been employed to recognise and determine the
effects of alternative measures, strategies and affecting parameters,
in order to make optimal decisions as a result of this knowledge.</p>


<p class="block">Operational research, especially in planning and
management tasks, first of all proves to offer a high number of various
methods; with their aid, we can solve complicated analysis and
optimisation tasks. The preconditions for applying such methods are
particularly favourable at Nordland Papier GmbH: a receptive, dynamic
management pushes the application of modern, management methods, which
display their full effectiveness by analysing them with a powerful data
processing machine in connection with convenient EDP standard programs.</p>


<p><b>Nordland Papier GmbH</b></p>

<p class="block">Nordland Papier GmbH is a young enterprise that was established a 
few years ago in the Emsland "on the green meadow": at the intersection of the coast 
canal, the river Ems and two federal roads, the B 70 (Münster-Emden) and the 
B 401 (Oldenburg-Dörpen), near the Dutch border. The enterprise - with its 
around 600 employees and an annual turnover of approximately 100 million Euro - is 
one of the biggest German paper mills. It is under Finnish management, which enables 
a close connection to the source of raw materials. The range of products is wide: 
starting out with certain standard types of paper, and taking into account or 
combining, respectively, several qualities, paper weights and sizes, 
around 50 different product variants are produced, not only for the home market, 
but also for export. For an enterprise of such scale, electronic data procession 
is indispensable.</p>

</p><h2>Setting of the task</h2>

<p class="block">With an industry concern, special care needs to be
taken that products and performances, qualitatively and quantitatively,
meet the demands of the market. This is a necessary precondition to
achieve a good economic result.</p>

<p class="block">However, there is more than just achieving this
objective: gaining an economic result that is, under circumstances
given, optimal in every respect. Optimising methods therefore apply to
all important business areas:</p>

<dir>
<p>
• production<br>
• storage<br>
• equipment<br>
• sales<br>
• transport<br>
• finances<br>
• procuring<br>
• personal</p>
</dir>
<br>

<p class="block">In practise, optimising tasks very often focus on several areas simultaneously.</p>


<p><b>Maximising the profit contribution</b></p>

<p class="block">At Nordland Papier GmbH, a typical operational
research problem is at the heart of things: maximising the profit
contribution, a problem that applies to several business areas, namely
production, procuring raw materials, sales, and finances. The
production program needs to be selected in a such a way that the
overall profit contribution, attained with all types of paper products
within a certain period of time (at Nordland Papier GmbH within a
budget year or shorter planning periods) is optimal. The difficulty of
this task lies in the high number of various capacity conditions that
need to be taken into account for the solution: the individual types of
product (these are, in LP terminology, the decision variables) take up
the limited production capacities in different ways, are themselves
composed of raw materials that may at times not be at hand unlimitedly,
and are subject to sales conditions, such as minimum quantities,
maximum quantities, etc.</p>


<p><b>Solution with Linear Programming</b></p>

<p class="block">This complex, so-called Linear Programming model (LP
model), which cannot be calculated with traditional mathematical
methods, constitutes a central building block for operative planning at
Nordland Papier GmbH. Its solution therefore constitutes a necessary
precondition for the yearly-developed budget planning, and consequently
becomes a decisive factor in managing the enterprise.</p>


<p class="block">Linear programming is one of the most important
methods in enterprise research. It is common to also refer to this
mathematical method as Linear Optimisation, in order to avoid confusion
with programming in the field of EDP. Its task is to select, out of a
number of possible production programs, the one that leads to an
optimal objective, which is described by an objective function. The
term linear here refers to the mathematical feature of the functions
describing the model, which is to be linear.</p>

<p align="center">
<b><font size="-1">How paper is produced: from the raw material to the end 
product</font></b></p>

<br>


<p><b>Model formulation and objective function</b></p>

<p class="block">In the LP model used by Nordland Papier GmbH, the
objective function indicates the maximisation of the overall profit
contribution. Behind this lies the question, which types of paper need
to be produced and sold in which quantities. The table, highly
simplified, clearly shows the LP setting of the task at Nordland Papier
GmbH.</p>
<p class="block">In order to explain the table, we randomly pick the type of paper A: with the aid of <i>calculations</i>,
we have ascertained a profit contribution of 100 EUR for A. For one
unit (in this case 1 t), the reel cutter needs 20 min., the horizontal
cutter 20 min., and the refining machine 15 min. One ton of type A is
composed of 0.70 t of birch (cellulose) and 0.25 t of pine (cellulose);
the rest are additives and fillings.</p>
<p class="block">Because of existing delivery obligations, a fixed 500
t of paper A needs to be delivered (minimum quantity). Market research
has found out that no more than 2,000 t can be sold (maximum quantity).</p>
<p class="block">The overall profit contribution that we want to
maximise is defined by the objective function (DB profit contribution,
X quantity in t).</p>

<p><font size="-1" face="verdana,arial"><b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
DB<sub>A</sub> * X<sub>A</sub> + DB<sub>B</sub> * X<sub>B</sub> + ...
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... + DB<sub>G</sub> * X<sub>G</sub> &nbsp; &#8594; &nbsp; Max!</b></font></p>

<p class="block">In this objective function, profit contributions are known, the quantities of the individual products are unknown.</p>

<br>

<font size="-1">Super calender with paper strip retracted<br> 
(working width 4.5 m)</font></p></center>

<br>

<p><b>Evaluation</b></p>

<p class="block">At first sight, one is tempted to produce solely the
type of paper E, as this yields the highest profit contribution. But
the solution shows the opposite, because type E has unfavourable
running times on the machines. For one unit, the reel cutter needs 20
min., and the horizontal cutter 60 min., whereas the refining machine
is used at all. Instead of paper E, we can produce the products A an B,
which yield a lower profit contribution, but are much more favourable
regarding their running times. The considerably higher quantity
compensates for the worse individual profit contribution.</p>


<p class="block">Products with this favourable feature cannot be
produced in unlimited quantities, as the capacity limits will be
reached at some point. These are:</p>


<dir>
<p>
• production capacities,<br>
• raw material capacities,<br>
• sales capacities.</p>
</dir>

<p class="block">Due to internal reasons, the capabilities of the machines that are needed for several products are limited for the <i>budget</i> <i>period</i>.
For instance, the reel cutter can currently only be operated for
300,000 min./year. A similar thing can happen with the raw materials:
there may be supply problems for the cellulose at certain times; only
the quantities of 43,000 t of birch and 9,500 t of pine, for example,
may be available, and need to be optimally included in the planning.
The market dictates further conditions, in form of minimum and/or
maximum quantities.</p>


<br>

<p><b>Theoretical foundations</b></p>

<p class="block">Mathematically speaking, this complex task is a system of linear 
equations and subordinate clauses in form of inequations; it is completed by 
so-called non-negativity restrictions (negative quantities are nonpermitted solutions). 
Such a system is in principle comparable to an equation system with a certain number 
of equations and an equal number of unknowns; it can be unambiguously solved with 
conventional mathematical means.<br>
However, being able to solve the LP model requires a new calculation technique; 
Dantzig developed a method that is by now known as Simplex method. This Simplex 
method, which is based on matrix calculation, and therefore particularly "computer 
friendly", is also - in revised form - the foundation of the Siemens system LP 5000, 
which is employed for the calculation of LP models with the aid of electronic data 
processing.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Program system LP5000</b></p>

<p class="block">LP 5000 stands out due to its considerable comfort, 
mathematically as well as in terms of EDP: it allows various standardised 
paper sizes and has several additional algorithms, which guarantee an 
optimal calculation process. A further distinguishing feature of LP 5000 are 
the short calculation times. Nordland Papier GmbH's practise model with around 
100 types of paper has, for example, an optimising time of approximately only one 
minute. The matrix consists of 181 rows (176 of which are subordinate clauses) and 
97 columns; its occupancy density, with all in all 750 elements, is 4.23 %. 
By comparison, a "manual" calculation of such a task, even with aids, for example 
an electronic pocket calculator, would take several weeks.</p>


<p class="block">Following a certain number of calculation steps (iterations), 
LP 5000 comes up with the solution and provides it in a clear form. The solution of 
the test example (confer the bottom of the table) first of all indicates the value 
of the objective function, 1,429,427 Euro. Under the circumstances given, it is 
impossible to achieve a higher profit contribution. The solution shows the optimal 
quantities for the types A to F. The quantities A, B correspond to the indicated 
maximum quantities, the quantities D, E, F to the indicated minimum quantities. 
Further, from the solution, we can gain an order for the individual products under 
commercial aspects.</p>


<br>
<p><img src="Kap9_en-Dateien/Image85.png" width="620" height="233"></p>
<br>

<p><b>Decidion alternatives</b></p>

<p class="block">The practical benefit for the decision taking does not
solely lie in the core solution, but also in the various numbers that
are additionally calculated, such as the used or unused capacities, but
also particularly in the so-called dual values. The dual values
indicate by how much the value of the objective function (overall
profit contribution) has improved or got worse, if we carry out
compulsory operations in the optimal solution in such a way that the
subordinate restrictions (e.g. reached capacity limits) is altered by
one unit. Hence, not only do we get an answer to the question of an
optimal production program, but also, in connection with shortage
considerations, to aspects in terms of investments or sales. In an
added sensibility analysis, LP 5000 indicates the limits within which
the effects of planned model operations can be linearly continued
before the solution "tips over", i.e. before a totally differently
structured solution becomes valid.</p>

<p class="block">The parameterisation in LP 5000 goes a step further:
whereas the sensibility analysis operates within a basic solution, the
parameterisation routine carries out the calculation of several
connected optimal solutions. In the relation given, the subordinate
restrictions of the problem are continuously altered until some
variables need to leave the basic solution to further ensure a
permitted solution.</p>

<p class="block">Making use of the possibilities of LP 5000, we get an
optimal program not only for the time being, but one that is also
constant for the future. With this, LP 5000 is an indispensable
strategic decision tool for Nordland Papier GmbH.</p>

<p class="block">LP 5000 cannot only be used in the paper industry. In
almost all other industry branches, there are numerous applications.
Some of these are:</p>


<p></p><ul>
<li>chemical industry, mainly refineries
</li><li>food an allied industry
</li><li>trade industry
</li><li>service industry
</li></ul><p></p>

<br>

<p class="block">Very often, LP programs occur in the aforementioned
first two branches of industry, that is everywhere where dispensing
occurs, e.g. cracking of mineral oil, mixing of a type of tobacco,
producing margarine, making fodder mixtures, etc. In these cases, the
objective function indicates the minimisation of costs for raw
materials or ingredients. For the trade industry, the transport problem
can be addressed in form of a route minimisation task, and therefore a
cost minimisation task. In any case, the precondition for an LP
formulation is to achieve an objective in an optimal manner with means
that are at a restricted disposal.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class="block">The use of the operational research method Linear
Programming LP 5000 at Nordland Papier GmbH proves the constantly
increasing importance of OR methods in practise. We can see in such a
case how much the profit situation at an enterprise can be positively
influenced. Moreover, the results find expression in numerous plannings
of an enterprise: short and medium-term for procuring, production and
sales in a narrow sense, long-term for general influences of market
conditions and production conditions (procuring, sales and investment).</p>

<p class="block">Following the positive experience of using of LP 5000
to date, Nordland Papier GmbH is contemplating to employ further
program systems by Siemens for the solution of OR problems,
particularly in the areas of offcut and storage optimisation.</p>
