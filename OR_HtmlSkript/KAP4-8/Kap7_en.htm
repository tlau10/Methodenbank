We speak of a transport problem if the following setting of a task is given:</P>

Goods in the quantities a<SUB>1</SUB>, a<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., a<SUB>n</SUB> are 
produced at n different production sites

Further, there are m demand places (B<SUB>1</SUB>, B<SUB>2</SUB>, ...,

<P align=justify>From the point of view of minimising the transport costs, it 
obviously matters which quantities from which production sites are transported 
to which demand places. Altogether, there are n x m transport routes, which is 
illustrated in fig. 16 (n = 3, m = 5):</P>

<P align=justify><font face="arial" size="-1"><b><i>
In contrast to the tasks of Linear Programming, we have so far seen that we can 
state two things:</i></b></font></P>

<P align=justify>First, the restrictions are given in the form of equations. Second, 
only the coefficients 0 and 1 occur in the restrictions.<br>
These unusual features suggest that we do not employ the Simplex method for solving 
the transport problem, but opt for a specific - easier - alternative.
This alternative shall be illustrated with a numerical example. The following specific 
problem shall be given:</P>

<P align=justify>
Three production sites A<SUB>1</SUB>, A<SUB>2</SUB>, 
A<SUB>3</SUB> with the quantities 
a<SUB>1</SUB> = 60, a<SUB>2</SUB> = 35, a<SUB>3</SUB> = 40.
Further, five demand places B<SUB>1</SUB>,...,B<SUB>5</SUB> with
b<SUB>1</SUB> = 22, b<SUB>2</SUB> = 45,
b<SUB>3</SUB> = 20, b<SUB>4</SUB> = 18, b<SUB>5</SUB> = 30.<br>

The cost factors c<SUB>ik</SUB> are each given in the scheme (fig. 17). 
What we want are the transport quantities X<SUB>ik</SUB>
(i = 1,...,3; k = 1,...,5), that lead to minimal transport costs.</P>

<P align=justify>Similar to the Simplex method, where we strive for the optimal 
solution through iteration, starting from an initial basic solution, here, we also 
look for a basic solution that we can then improve step by step. <u>Three questions</u>
need to be taken into account:</P>

<DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. How do we get an initial solution ?</P>

<h3>7.1.1 Initial solution</h3>

<P align=justify>
Generally, nothing prevents us from starting with an arbitrary initial solution. Nevertheless, it is not entirely arbitrary on which <I>quantity distribution</I> this<I> </I>is based. An "arbitrary initial solution" can be found by employing the north-west corner method. This method begins the allocation at the top left corner (hence north-west), covering (if possible) the demands of B<SUB>1</SUB>. Then the remainder of the production of A<SUB>1</SUB> (if such a remainder still exists) is distributed onto B<SUB>2</SUB>, etc., moving along the diagonal. Eventually, we get the quantity distribution illustrated in fig. 18.</P>


<P Align="center"><IMG SRC="P6.png" HEIGHT=320 WIDTH=502><br>
<span class="Abb">Fig. 18: initial solution employing the north-west method</span></P>

<br>

<P align=justify>This method is easy to handle, but in comparison to another method, which we shall discuss later, we see that the initial position is rather weak, because this procedure has not taken into account the objective of minimising the transport costs.</P>

<P align=justify>In the following, we are therefore going to illustrate a method 
that within a row of the scheme allocates, in order, reduced cost factors to the 
demand places. Then it goes on to the next row: method with fixed row order. The 
result of this procedure is depicted in fig. 19.</P>

<br>

<P><IMG SRC="P7.png" HEIGHT=355 WIDTH=650>
<br>
<span class="Abb">

&nbsp; and &nbsp;
<IMG SRC="beta.gif"><SUB>k</SUB> = b<SUB>k</SUB> - x<SUB>ik</SUB>
</span>
</P></CENTER>


<P align=justify>The individual numbers yield as follows, beginning with the first row of the cost matrix:</P>

<p align=justify>The position A<SUB>1</SUB>/B<SUB>2</SUB> has the lowest cost factor. 
The demand of B<SUB>2</SUB> is b<SUB>2</SUB> = 45. This demand can be met by the 
production of A<SUB>1</SUB>, namely a<SUB>1</SUB> = 60. With x<SUB>12</SUB> = 45, 
we get <IMG SRC="beta.gif"><SUB>2</SUB> = 0 and <img src="alpha.gif"><SUB>1</SUB> = 15. 
The next highest cost factor can be found in A<SUB>1</SUB>/B<SUB>3</SUB>. The demand of 
B<SUB>3</SUB>, namely b<SUB>3</SUB> = 20, however, cannot be fully met by the remaining
<img src="alpha.gif"><SUB>1</SUB> = 15; therefore we get x<SUB>13</SUB> = 15. This leads 
to <IMG SRC="beta.gif"><SUB>3</SUB> = 5 and <img src="alpha.gif"><SUB>1</SUB> = 0. That 
means we have completed row 1, because the production of A<SUB>1</SUB> has completely 
been reduced.</P>

<p align=justify>In the second row, we begin with A<SUB>2</SUB>/B<SUB>1</SUB>, 
let x<SUB>21</SUB> = 22, <IMG SRC="beta.gif"><SUB>1</SUB> = 0, 
and <IMG SRC="alpha.gif"><SUB>2</SUB> = 13. 
Then x<SUB>23</SUB> = 5, <IMG SRC="beta.gif"><SUB>3</SUB> = 0, 
and <IMG SRC="alpha.gif"><SUB>2</SUB> = 8. 
Eventually, x<SUB>24</SUB> = 8, <IMG SRC="beta.gif"><SUB>4</SUB> = 10, 
and <IMG SRC="alpha.gif"><SUB>2</SUB> = 0. 
That means that the production of A<SUB>2</SUB> has also become zero.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third row is treated in the same way.</P>
<br>

<P align=justify>This second initial solution is usually better than the one we get 
with the north-west corner method, because the latter amounts to a total cost of 
K<SUB>1</SUB> = <SUB><IMG SRC="Img7013.gif" HEIGHT=36 WIDTH=30> 
<IMG SRC="Img7014.gif" HEIGHT=36 WIDTH=30></SUB> 
c<SUB>ij</SUB> x<SUB>ij</SUB> = 363, whereas here we get K<SUB>2</SUB> = 320.</P>

<p align=justify>Now we can see why the first solution was described as weak, in the sense of being "too far away from the optimal solution".
As we will transform the initial solution, improving it step by step, into the optimal solution, and understandably keeping the number of steps to a minimum, it is obvious that we select the best initial solution as <I>basis/base</I>, here the solution with the method of fixed row order.</P>

<h3>7.1.2 Stepping stone method</h3>

<P align=justify>If we now want to improve the current solution, we can only do so by altering the quantity distribution plan that we have arranged. This alteration, of course, needs to be carried out with the objective of reducing the total transport costs. The question arises, though, whether the existing transport plan may already be optimal. To ascertain this, we analyse whether we can achieve a reduction of the costs by including transport connections we have so far not considered.<br>
With this aim in view, we select the positions with X<SUB>ik</SUB> = 0 in the above schema; we then calculate which costs occur or can be saved, if we let these X<SUB>ik</SUB> = 1. This arrangement, though, affects the restrictions, because the corresponding a<SUB>i </SUB>and b<SUB>k</SUB> are also both increased by 1.<br>
To adjust this, we need to subtract the amount 1 from the already existing transport amounts. An example (position A<SUB>1</SUB>/B<SUB>1</SUB>) from the above schema will illustrate this:<br>
Adding 1 in A<SUB>1</SUB>/B<SUB>1</SUB> implies subtracting 1 in A<SUB>1</SUB>/B<SUB>3</SUB>. Therefore, we need to increase A<SUB>2</SUB>/B<SUB>3</SUB> by 1, which, in turn, implies subtracting 1 in A<SUB>2</SUB>/B<SUB>1</SUB> (see fig. 20). For this "jumping" over occupied positions, there is always only one position per route.</P>


<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="P66.png" HEIGHT=262 WIDTH=350><BR>
<span class="Abb">Fig. 20: alteration of the quantity distribution with activation<br>
of a further transport route.</span>
</P></CENTER>

<P align=justify>Adding and subtracting 1, respectively, is balanced, i.e. the restrictions are not affected. Of interest now are the new costs, which are generally indicated by V<SUB>ik</SUB>; thus, in our case, V<SUB>11</SUB>:</P>


<ul><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#009020"><b>
   V<SUB>11</SUB> = 1 * c<SUB>11</SUB> - 1 * c<SUB>13</SUB> + 1 * 
      c<SUB>23</SUB> - 1 * c<SUB>21</SUB><br>
   V<SUB>11</SUB> = 4 - 3 + 2 - 2<br>
   V<SUB>11</SUB> = 1<br>
</b></font>
</ul>
<br>

<p align=justify>In this case, the costs have been increased, that is by including these transport connections that have so far not been considered, additional costs of one transportation unit per quantity unit occur. The objective, however, was to save costs.
<BR>
The above method now needs to be carried out for all positions where x<SUB>ik</SUB> = 0. This yields to the scheme (fig. 21) where the v<SUB>ik</SUB> are printed in small.</P>
<br>

<P align="center">
<IMG SRC="P67I.png" HEIGHT=270 WIDTH=440><br>
<span class="Abb">Fig. 21: initial solution with inserted coefficients V<SUB>k</SUB> .<br>
In the framed position lies min (V<SUB>k</SUB>)</span>
</P>


<P align=justify>We can see that saving is only possible in two positions, namely 
A<sub>3</sub>/B<sub>1</sub> (V<SUB>31</SUB> = -1) and 
A<sub>3</sub>/B<sub>3</sub> (V<sub>33</sub> = -2). 
If we limit each iteration step to one alteration, we will, of course, attempt to 
transport as many quantity units as possible along the route A<SUB>3</SUB>/B<SUB>3</SUB>, 
as we can save the most here. However, we have an upper limit, since, due to the 
restrictions, we also need to alter the quantities in those positions whose cost 
factors have been used in ascertaining V<SUB>33</SUB>. Even here, we still cannot 
proceed arbitrarily. If, for example, we want to transfer six units from A<SUB>3</SUB> 
to B<SUB>3</SUB>, we would need to have - for not exceeding the demand of B<SUB>3</SUB>, 
namely 20 - the value -1 in position A<SUB>2</SUB>/B<SUB>3</SUB>; this, however, 
violates the non-negativity retriction. Generally we can say that the new 
x<SUB>ik</SUB> is only permitted to be as high as the lowest amount whose cost 
factor with negative sign was included in calculating V<SUB>33</SUB>; thus, 
on our case, x<SUB>33</SUB> = 5.</P>


<P align=justify>Inserting this, while simultaneously altering the other positions in such a way that the restrictions are still satisfied, yields the first improved solution (the new V<SUB>ik</SUB> have already been entered) in the schema (fig. 22).</P>

<br>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="P67II.png" HEIGHT=257 WIDTH=440><BR>
<span class="Abb">Fig. 22: first improved solution</span>
</P></CENTER>
<br>


<P align=justify>For this improved solution, K = 310 yields, that is a reduction by 10 transportation units. However, we can see from the negative V<SUB>ik</SUB>, that an improvement is possible again. (The additional arrows in the last schema illustrate the route that has been followed for the slightly more difficult calculation of V<SUB>22</SUB>).</P>

<P>The method outlined here:
<ul>
<li>calculation of V<SUB>ik</SUB>, and
<li>activation of transport connections with min (V<SUB>ik</SUB>)
</ul>

<P>is the so-called stepping stone method.</P>

<P align=justify>We now want to further improve the scheme (fig. 22). We only indicate the results in tabular form, without a detailed outline of the individual operations (fig. 23).</P>


<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="P68I.png" HEIGHT=270 WIDTH=440><BR>
<span class="Abb">Fig. 23: improved solution</span>
</P></CENTER>

<br><BR>

<p>This solution K = 295, too, can be improved, because of V<SUB>31</SUB> = -1. 
The next iteration (fig. 24) yields the optimal solution, as no V<SUB>ik</SUB> &lt; 0.</P>

</P></CENTER>

<BR><BR>

<P>The minimal transport costs are K = 290.</P>

<P align=justify>In addition, because of V<SUB>25</SUB> = 0, there is an alternative optimal plan to this optimal transport plan. V<SUB>25</SUB> indicates that the total costs neither increase nor decrease, if we activate the transport connection A<SUB>2</SUB>/B<SUB>5</SUB>. This case would lead to the plan (fig. 25) where, too, K = 290.</P>

<h3>7.1.3 Additional thoughts</h3>

<P align=justify>
In the setting of the task, we presupposed that the amount of production and the 
amount of demand were equal. This precondition is not always given, and we do not 
want to analyse the case where the the amount of production is higher than the total 
demand. 
In numbers: a<sub>1</sub> = 60, a<sub>2</sub> = 100, 
a<sub>3</sub> = 40; b<sub>1</sub> = 22, b<sub>2</sub> = 45, b<sub>3</sub> = 20, 
b<sub>4</sub> = 18, b<sub>5</sub> = 30. 
The production exceeds the demand by 65 transportation units. Applying the <I>convention</I> of Linear Programming yields:</P>

</dir>
<br>


<p><b>
To be able to apply the stepping stone method here as well, we need to consider 
the following:</b></P>

<P align=justify>If the production is higher than the demand, it only makes sense that quantities are stocked at the production sites. In order to ascertain these quantities, we can establish a fictive storage place L that serves as a common storage for the 3 <I>production sites</I> A<SUB>1</SUB>, A<SUB>2</SUB>, A<SUB>3.</SUB> The quantities that are "transported" to L from A<SUB>1</SUB>, A<SUB>2</SUB>, A<SUB>3</SUB> will, of course, be included in the calculation with the cost factors zero.
In reality, they are the quantities that are kept at the production sites.</P>

<P align=justify>The two schemes (fig. 26 and 27) depict the initial solution and the optimal solution, which is achieved after 4 iteration steps.</P>


<br>

<P align="center"><IMG SRC="P70.png" HEIGHT=268 WIDTH=500><BR>
<span class="Abb">Fig. 26: initial solution</span></P>
<br>

<P align=justify>To get a better idea, we have left out the V<SUB>ik</SUB> in this 
depiction. The result can be interpreted as follows:<br>
15 transprotation units remain at production site A<SUB>1</SUB>, 30 at A<SUB>2</SUB>, 
and 20 at A<SUB>3</SUB>. The rest in each production site is distributed to the 
demand places according to the above scheme.</P>

<P align=justify>This example presupposed that the amount of production is higher 
than the amount of demand. Of course, this can also be the other way round. In that 
case, we establish a fictive production site to which we allocate the deficit of the 
total amount. By including this fictive production site into the calculation schema, 
the final result yields quantities that need to be transported from these fictive 
production sites to the individual demand places. We then interpret these quantities 
as the deficit of the individual demand places.</P>
