perlfunc - Perl builtin functions
<p><p><hr>

<A NAME="perlfunc_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The functions in this section can serve as terms in an expression.
They fall into two major categories: list operators and named unary
operators.  These differ in their precedence relationship with a
following comma.  (See the precedence table in the <EM>perlop</EM>  manpage
.)  List
operators take more than one argument, while unary operators can never
take more than one argument.  Thus, a comma terminates the argument of
a unary operator, but merely separates the arguments of a list
operator.  A unary operator generally provides a scalar context to its
argument, while a list operator may provide either scalar and list
contexts for its arguments.  If it does both, the scalar arguments will
be first, and the list argument will follow.  (Note that there can only
ever be one list argument.)  For instance, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_splice_2">splice()</A>
 has three scalar
arguments followed by a list.
<p>In the syntax descriptions that follow, list operators that expect a
list (and provide list context for the elements of the list) are shown
with LIST as an argument.  Such a list may consist of any combination
of scalar arguments or list values; the list values will be included
in the list as if each individual element were interpolated at that
point in the list, forming a longer single-dimensional list value.
Elements of the LIST should be separated by commas.
<p>Any function in the list below may be used either with or without
parentheses around its arguments.  (The syntax descriptions omit the
parens.)  If you use the parens, the simple (but occasionally
surprising) rule is this: It <EM>LOOKS</EM> like a function, therefore it <EM>IS</EM> a
function, and precedence doesn't matter.  Otherwise it's a list
operator or unary operator, and precedence does matter.  And whitespace
between the function and left parenthesis doesn't count--so you need to
be careful sometimes:
<p>
<XMP>
    print 1+2+3;        # Prints 6.
    print(1+2) + 3;     # Prints 3.
    print (1+2)+3;      # Also prints 3!
    print +(1+2)+3;     # Prints 6.
    print ((1+2)+3);    # Prints 6.

</XMP>
<p>If you run Perl with the <STRONG>-w</STRONG> switch it can warn you about this.  For
example, the third line above produces:
<p>
<XMP>
    print (...) interpreted as function at - line 1.
    Useless use of integer addition in void context at - line 1.

</XMP>
<p>For functions that can be used in either a scalar or list context,
non-abortive failure is generally indicated in a scalar context by
returning the undefined value, and in a list context by returning the
null list.
<p>Remember the following rule:

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
</DL>
Each operator and function decides which sort of value it would be mostappropriate to return in a scalar context.  Some operators return the
length of the list that would have been returned in a list context.  Some
operators return the first value in the list.  Some operators return the
last value in the list.  Some operators return a count of successful
operations.  In general, they do what you want, unless you want
consistency.

-X</A>

<DD>
A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below.  This unary
operator takes one argument, either a filename or a filehandle, and
tests the associated file to see if something is true about it.  If the
argument is omitted, tests <STRONG>$_</STRONG>, except for <CODE>-t</CODE>, which tests STDIN.
Unless otherwise documented, it returns <CODE>1</CODE> for TRUE and <CODE>''</CODE> for FALSE, or
the undefined value if the file doesn't exist.  Despite the funny
names, precedence is the same as any other named unary operator, and
the argument may be parenthesized like any other unary operator.  The
operator may be any of:
<p>
<XMP>
    -r  File is readable by effective uid/gid.
    -w  File is writable by effective uid/gid.
    -x  File is executable by effective uid/gid.
    -o  File is owned by effective uid.
    -R  File is readable by real uid/gid.
    -W  File is writable by real uid/gid.
    -X  File is executable by real uid/gid.
    -O  File is owned by real uid.
    -e  File exists.
    -z  File has zero size.
    -s  File has non-zero size (returns size).
    -f  File is a plain file.
    -d  File is a directory.
    -l  File is a symbolic link.
    -p  File is a named pipe (FIFO).
    -S  File is a socket.
    -b  File is a block special file.
    -c  File is a character special file.
    -t  Filehandle is opened to a tty.
    -u  File has setuid bit set.
    -g  File has setgid bit set.
    -k  File has sticky bit set.
    -T  File is a text file.
    -B  File is a binary file (opposite of -T).
    -M  Age of file in days when script started.
    -A  Same for access time.
    -C  Same for inode change time.

</XMP>
<p>The interpretation of the file permission operators <CODE>-r</CODE>, <CODE>-R</CODE>, <CODE>-w</CODE>,
<CODE>-W</CODE>, <CODE>-x</CODE> and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_x_0">-X</A>
 is based solely on the mode of the file and the
uids and gids of the user.  There may be other reasons you can't actually
read, write or execute the file.  Also note that, for the superuser,
<CODE>-r</CODE>, <CODE>-R</CODE>, <CODE>-w</CODE> and <CODE>-W</CODE> always return 1, and <CODE>-x</CODE> and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_x_0">-X</A>
 return
1 if any execute bit is set in the mode.  Scripts run by the superuser may
thus need to do a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_stat_1">stat()</A>
 in order to determine the actual mode of the
file, or temporarily set the uid to something else.
<p>Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        chop;
        next unless -f $_;      # ignore specials
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>Note that <CODE>-s/a/b/</CODE> does not do a negated substitution.  Saying
<CODE>-exp(<STRONG>$foo</STRONG>)</CODE> still works as expected, however--only single letters
following a minus are interpreted as file tests.
<p>The <CODE>-T</CODE> and <CODE>-B</CODE> switches work as follows.  The first block or so of the
file is examined for odd characters such as strange control codes or
characters with the high bit set.  If too many odd characters (&gt;30%)
are found, it's a <CODE>-B</CODE> file, otherwise it's a <CODE>-T</CODE> file.  Also, any file
containing null in the first block is considered a binary file.  If <CODE>-T</CODE>
or <CODE>-B</CODE> is used on a filehandle, the current stdio buffer is examined
rather than the first block.  Both <CODE>-T</CODE> and <CODE>-B</CODE> return TRUE on a null
file, or a file at EOF when testing a filehandle.  Because you have to 
read a file to do the <CODE>-T</CODE> test, on most occasions you want to use a <CODE>-f</CODE>
against the file first, as in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_next_0">next unless -f <STRONG>$file</STRONG> &amp;&amp; -T <STRONG>$file</STRONG></A>
.
<p>If any of the file tests (or either the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_stat_1">stat()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_lstat_1">lstat()</A>
 operators) are given the
special filehandle consisting of a solitary underline, then the stat
structure of the previous file test (or stat operator) is used, saving
a system call.  (This doesn't work with <CODE>-t</CODE>, and you need to remember
that 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_lstat_1">lstat()</A>
 and <CODE>-l</CODE> will leave values in the stat structure for the
symbolic link, not the real file.)  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "Can do.\n" if -r $a || -w _ || -x _;
    stat($filename);
    print "Readable\n" if -r _;
    print "Writable\n" if -w _;
    print "Executable\n" if -x _;
    print "Setuid\n" if -u _;
    print "Setgid\n" if -g _;
    print "Sticky\n" if -k _;
    print "Text\n" if -T _;
    print "Binary\n" if -B _;

<A NAME="perlfunc_abs_0">
abs VALUE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the absolute value of its argument.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_accept_0">
accept NEWSOCKET,GENERICSOCKET</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Accepts an incoming socket connect, just as the accept(2) system call
does.  Returns the packed address if it succeeded, FALSE otherwise.
See example in <EM>``Sockets: Client/Server Communication''</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_alarm_0">
alarm SECONDS</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Arranges to have a SIGALRM delivered to this process after the
specified number of seconds have elapsed.  (On some machines,
unfortunately, the elapsed time may be up to one second less than you
specified because of how seconds are counted.)  Only one timer may be
counting at once.  Each call disables the previous timer, and an
argument of 0 may be supplied to cancel the previous timer without
starting a new one.  The returned value is the amount of time remaining
on the previous timer.
<p>For delays of finer granularity than one second, you may use Perl's

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_syscall_0">syscall()</A>
 interface to access setitimer(2) if your system supports it, 
or else see 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1"><EM>select</EM></A>
 below.  It is not advised to intermix 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_alarm_0">alarm()</A>
 
and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sleep_0">sleep()</A>
 calls.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_atan_0">
atan2 Y,X</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the arctangent of Y/X in the range -PI to PI.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_bind_0">
bind SOCKET,NAME</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Binds a network address to a socket, just as the bind system call
does.  Returns TRUE if it succeeded, FALSE otherwise.  NAME should be a
packed address of the appropriate type for the socket.  See the examples in
<EM>``Sockets: Client/Server Communication''</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_binmode_0">
binmode FILEHANDLE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Arranges for the file to be read or written in ``binary'' mode in operating
systems that distinguish between binary and text files.  Files that are
not in binary mode have CR LF sequences translated to LF on input and LF
translated to CR LF on output.  Binmode has no effect under Unix; in DOS
and similarly archaic systems, it may be imperative--otherwise your
DOS-damaged C library may mangle your file.  The key distinction between
systems that need binmode and those that don't is their text file
formats.  Systems like Unix and Plan9 that delimit lines with a single
character, and that encode that character in C as '\n', do not need

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_binmode_0">binmode</A>
.  The rest need it.  If FILEHANDLE is an expression, the value
is taken as the name of the filehandle.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_bless_0">
bless REF,CLASSNAME</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_bless_1">
bless REF</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This function tells the referenced object (passed as REF) that it is now
an object in the CLASSNAME package--or the current package if no CLASSNAME
is specified, which is often the case.  It returns the reference for
convenience, since a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_bless_1">bless()</A>
 is often the last thing in a constructor.
Always use the two-argument version if the function doing the blessing
might be inherited by a derived class.  See the <EM>perlobj</EM>  manpage
 for more about the
blessing (and blessings) of objects.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_caller_0">
caller EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_caller_0">
caller</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the context of the current subroutine call.  In a scalar context,
returns TRUE if there is a caller, that is, if we're in a subroutine or

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require()</A>
, and FALSE otherwise.  In a list context, returns
<p>
<XMP>
    ($package, $filename, $line) = caller;

</XMP>
<p>With EXPR, it returns some extra information that the debugger uses to
print a stack trace.  The value of EXPR indicates how many call frames
to go back before the current one.
<p>
<XMP>
    ($package, $filename, $line,
     $subroutine, $hasargs, $wantargs) = caller($i);

</XMP>
<p>Furthermore, when called from within the DB package, caller returns more
detailed information: it sets the list variable <STRONG>@DB::args</STRONG> to be the
arguments with which that subroutine was invoked.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_chdir_0">
chdir EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Changes the working directory to EXPR, if possible.  If EXPR is
omitted, changes to home directory.  Returns TRUE upon success, FALSE
otherwise.  See example under 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_chmod_0">
chmod LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Changes the permissions of a list of files.  The first element of the
list must be the numerical mode, which should probably be an octal
number.  Returns the number of files successfully changed.
<p>
<XMP>
    $cnt = chmod 0755, 'foo', 'bar';
    chmod 0755, @executables;

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_chomp_0">
chomp VARIABLE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_chomp_1">
chomp</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This is a slightly safer version of chop (see below).  It removes any
line ending that corresponds to the current value of <CODE>$/</CODE> (also known as
<STRONG>$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR</STRONG> in the <CODE>English</CODE> module).  It returns the number
of characters removed.  It's often used to remove the newline from the
end of an input record when you're worried that the final record may be
missing its newline.  When in paragraph mode (<CODE>$/ = ``''</CODE>), it removes all
trailing newlines from the string.  If VARIABLE is omitted, it chomps
<STRONG>$_</STRONG>.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        chomp;  # avoid \n on last field
        @array = split(/:/);
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>You can actually chomp anything that's an lvalue, including an assignment:
<p>
<XMP>
    chomp($cwd = `pwd`);
    chomp($answer = <STDIN>);

</XMP>
<p>If you chomp a list, each element is chomped, and the total number of
characters removed is returned.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_chop_0">
chop VARIABLE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_chop_1">
chop LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_chop_1">
chop</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Chops off the last character of a string and returns the character
chopped.  It's used primarily to remove the newline from the end of an
input record, but is much more efficient than <CODE>s/\n//</CODE> because it neither
scans nor copies the string.  If VARIABLE is omitted, chops <STRONG>$_</STRONG>.
Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        chop;   # avoid \n on last field
        @array = split(/:/);
        ...
    }

</XMP>
<p>You can actually chop anything that's an lvalue, including an assignment:
<p>
<XMP>
    chop($cwd = `pwd`);
    chop($answer = <STDIN>);

</XMP>
<p>If you chop a list, each element is chopped.  Only the value of the
last chop is returned.
<p>Note that chop returns the last character.  To return all but the last
character, use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_substr_1">substr(<STRONG>$string</STRONG>, 0, -1)</A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_chown_0">
chown LIST</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Changes the owner (and group) of a list of files.  The first two
elements of the list must be the <EM>NUMERICAL</EM> uid and gid, in that order.
Returns the number of files successfully changed.
<p>
<XMP>
    $cnt = chown $uid, $gid, 'foo', 'bar';
    chown $uid, $gid, @filenames;

</XMP>
<p>Here's an example that looks up non-numeric uids in the passwd file:
<p>
<XMP>
    print "User: ";
    chop($user = <STDIN>);
    print "Files: "
    chop($pattern = <STDIN>);
    ($login,$pass,$uid,$gid) = getpwnam($user)
        or die "$user not in passwd file";
    @ary = <${pattern}>;        # expand filenames
    chown $uid, $gid, @ary;

</XMP>
<p>On most systems, you are not allowed to change the ownership of the

<A NAME="perlfunc_chr_0">
chr NUMBER</A>

 is ``A'' in ASCII.

<A NAME="perlfunc_chroot_0">
chroot FILENAME</A>

<DD>
This function works as the system call by the same name: it makes the
named directory the new root directory for all further pathnames that
begin with a ``/'' by your process and all of its children.  (It doesn't
change your current working directory is unaffected.)  For security

<A NAME="perlfunc_close_0">
close FILEHANDLE</A>

<DD>
Closes the file or pipe associated with the file handle, returning TRUE
only if stdio successfully flushes buffers and closes the system file
descriptor.  You don't have to close FILEHANDLE if you are immediately
going to do another 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 on it, since 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 will close it for you.  (See

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
.)  However, an explicit close on an input file resets the line
counter ($.), while the implicit close done by 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 does not.  Also,
closing a pipe will wait for the process executing on the pipe to
complete, in case you want to look at the output of the pipe
afterwards.  Closing a pipe explicitly also puts the status value of
the command into <CODE>$?</CODE>.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(OUTPUT, '|sort >foo'); # pipe to sort
    ...                         # print stuff to output

Actually a flow control statement rather than a function.  If there is a

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_continue_0">continue</A>
 BLOCK attached to a BLOCK (typically in a <CODE>while</CODE> or
<CODE>foreach</CODE>), it is always executed just before the conditional is about to
be evaluated again, just like the third part of a <CODE>for</CODE> loop in C.  Thus
it can be used to increment a loop variable, even when the loop has been
continued via the

Encrypts a string exactly like the crypt(3) function in the C library

extirpated as a potential munition).  This can prove useful for checking
the password file for lousy passwords, amongst other things.  Only the
guys wearing white hats should do this.
<p>Here's an example that makes sure that whoever runs this program knows
their own password:
<p>
<XMP>

</STRONG>
<DD>
[This function has been superseded by the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>
 function.]
<p>This binds a dbm(3), ndbm(3), sdbm(3), <EM>gdbm()</EM>, or Berkeley DB file to an
associative array.  ASSOC is the name of the associative array.  (Unlike
normal open, the first argument is <EM>NOT</EM> a filehandle, even though it
looks like one).  DBNAME is the name of the database (without the <EM>.dir</EM>
or <EM>.pag</EM> extension if any).  If the database does not exist, it is
created with protection specified by MODE (as modified by the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_umask_0">umask()</A>
).
If your system only supports the older DBM functions, you may perform only
one 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_dbmopen_0">dbmopen()</A>
 in your program.  In older versions of Perl, if your system
had neither DBM nor ndbm, calling 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_dbmopen_0">dbmopen()</A>
 produced a fatal error; it now
falls back to sdbm(3).
<p>If you don't have write access to the DBM file, you can only read
associative array variables, not set them.  If you want to test whether
you can write, either use file tests or try setting a dummy array entry
inside an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
, which will trap the error.
<p>Note that functions such as 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_values_0">values()</A>
 may return huge array
values when used on large DBM files.  You may prefer to use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>

function to iterate over large DBM files.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    # print out history file offsets
    dbmopen(%HIST,'/usr/lib/news/history',0666);
    while (($key,$val) = each %HIST) {
        print $key, ' = ', unpack('L',$val), "\n";
    }
    dbmclose(%HIST);

<A NAME="perlfunc_defined_0">
defined EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns a boolean value saying whether EXPR has a real value
or not.  Many operations return the undefined value under exceptional
conditions, such as end of file, uninitialized variable, system error
and such.  This function allows you to distinguish between an undefined
null scalar and a defined null scalar with operations that might return
a real null string, such as referencing elements of an array.  You may
also check to see if arrays or subroutines exist.  Use of defined on
predefined variables is not guaranteed to produce intuitive results.
<p>When used on a hash array element, it tells you whether the value
is defined, not whether the key exists in the hash.  Use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_exists_0">exists()</A>
 for that.
<p>Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    print if defined $switch{'D'};
    print "$val\n" while defined($val = pop(@ary));
    die "Can't readlink $sym: $!"
        unless defined($value = readlink $sym);
    eval '@foo = ()' if defined(@foo);
    die "No XYZ package defined" unless defined %_XYZ;
    sub foo { defined &$bar ? &$bar(@_) : die "No bar"; }

</XMP>
<p>See also 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef()</A>

<p>Note: many folks tend to overuse 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined()</A>
, and then are surprised to
discover that the number 0 and the null string are, in fact, defined
concepts.  For example, if you say
<p>
<XMP>
    "ab" =~ /a(.*)b/;

</XMP>
<p>the pattern match succeeds, and <STRONG>$1</STRONG> is defined, despite the fact that it
matched ``nothing''.  But it didn't really match nothing--rather, it
matched something that happened to be 0 characters long.  This is all
very above-board and honest.  When a function returns an undefined value,
it's an admission that it couldn't give you an honest answer.  So
you should only use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined()</A>
 when you're questioning the integrity
of what you're trying to do.  At other times, a simple comparison to
0 or ``'' is what you want.

<A NAME="perlfunc_delete_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
Deletes the specified value from its hash array.  Returns the deleted
value, or the undefined value if nothing was deleted.  Deleting from
<CODE><STRONG>$ENV</STRONG>{}</CODE> modifies the environment.  Deleting from an array tied to a DBM
file deletes the entry from the DBM file.  (But deleting from a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_tie_0">tie()</A>

<p>The following deletes all the values of an associative array:
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $key (keys %ARRAY) {
        delete $ARRAY{$key};
    }

</XMP>
<p>(But it would be faster to use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef()</A>

a hash key lookup:

exits with 255.  Inside an

<p>If the value of EXPR does not end in a newline, the current script line
number and input line number (if any) are also printed, and a newline
is supplied.  Hint: sometimes appending ``, stopped'' to your message

appended.  Suppose you are running script ``canasta''.
<p>
<XMP>
    die "/etc/games is no good";

When called in a list context, returns a 2-element array consisting
of the key and value for the next element of an associative array,
so that you can iterate over it.  When called in a scalar context,
returns the key only for the next element in the associative array.
Entries are returned in an apparently random order.  When the array is
entirely read, a null array is returned in list context (which when
assigned produces a FALSE (0) value), and

 is returned in a

Returns 1 if the next read on FILEHANDLE will return end of file, or if
FILEHANDLE is not open.  FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value
gives the real filehandle name.  (Note that this function actually
reads a character and then <EM>ungetc()</EM>s it, so it is not very useful in an

as terminals may lose the end-of-file condition if you do.
<p>An

 is reasonable to use inside a while (&lt;&gt;) loop to detect the end

<DD>
EXPR is parsed and executed as if it were a little Perl program.  It
is executed in the context of the current Perl program, so that any
variable settings, subroutine or format definitions remain afterwards.
The value returned is the value of the last expression evaluated, or a
return statement may be used, just as with subroutines.
<p>If there is a syntax error or runtime error, or a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
 statement is
executed, an undefined value is returned by 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
, and <CODE>$@</CODE> is set to the
error message.  If there was no error, <CODE>$@</CODE> is guaranteed to be a null
string.  If EXPR is omitted, evaluates <STRONG>$_</STRONG>.  The final semicolon, if
any, may be omitted from the expression.
<p>Note that, since 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>
 traps otherwise-fatal errors, it is useful for
determining whether a particular feature (such as 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_socket_0">socket()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_symlink_0">symlink()</A>
)
is implemented.  It is also Perl's exception trapping mechanism, where
the die operator is used to raise exceptions.
<p>If the code to be executed doesn't vary, you may use the eval-BLOCK
form to trap run-time errors without incurring the penalty of
recompiling each time.  The error, if any, is still returned in <CODE>$@</CODE>.
Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    # make divide-by-zero non-fatal
    eval { $answer = $a / $b; }; warn $@ if $@;
    # same thing, but less efficient
    eval '$answer = $a / $b'; warn $@ if $@;
    # a compile-time error
    eval { $answer = };
    # a run-time error
    eval '$answer =';   # sets $@

</XMP>
<p>With an 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_eval_1">eval()</A>

being looked at when:
<p>
<XMP>
    eval $x;            # CASE 1
    eval "$x";          # CASE 2
    eval '$x';          # CASE 3

    eval "\$$x++"       # CASE 5
    $$x++;              # CASE 6

</XMP>
<p>Cases 1 and 2 above behave identically: they run the code contained in the
variable <STRONG>$x</STRONG>.  (Although case 2 has misleading double quotes making the
reader wonder what else might be happening (nothing is).) Cases 3 and 4
likewise behave in the same way: they run the code &lt;<STRONG>$x</STRONG>&gt;, which does
nothing at all.  (Case 4 is preferred for purely visual reasons.) Case 5
is a place where normally you <EM>WOULD</EM> like to use double quotes, except
that in that particular situation, you can just use symbolic references

<p>
<XMP>
    exec '/bin/echo', 'Your arguments are: ', @ARGV;

<p>If you don't really want to execute the first argument, but want to lie
to the program you are executing about its own name, you can specify
the program you actually want to run as an ``indirect object'' (without a
comma) in front of the LIST.  (This always forces interpretation of the
LIST as a multi-valued list, even if there is only a single scalar in
the list.)  Example:

Note: unflushed buffers remain unflushed in both processes, which means

This is an internal function used by 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_format_0">format</A>
s, though you may call it

) a list of values according to the
contents of PICTURE, placing the output into the format output
accumulator, <CODE><STRONG>$^</STRONG>A</CODE> (or <STRONG>$ACCUMULATOR</STRONG> in English).
Eventually, when a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write()</A>
 is done, the contents of
<CODE><STRONG>$^</STRONG>A</CODE> are written to some filehandle, but you could also read <CODE><STRONG>$^</STRONG>A</CODE>
yourself and then set <CODE><STRONG>$^</STRONG>A</CODE> back to ``''.  Note that a format typically
does one 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_formline_0">formline()</A>
 per line of form, but the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_formline_0">formline()</A>
 function itself
doesn't care how many newlines are embedded in the PICTURE.  This means
that the <CODE>~</CODE> and <CODE>~~</CODE> tokens will treat the entire PICTURE as a single line.
You may therefore need to use multiple formlines to implement a single
record format, just like the format compiler.
<p>Be careful if you put double quotes around the picture, since an ``<CODE>@</CODE>''
character may be taken to mean the beginning of an array name.

This is not particularly efficient.  It cannot be used to get unbuffered

The goto-LABEL form finds the statement labeled with LABEL and resumes
execution there.  It may not be used to go into any construct that
requires initialization, such as a subroutine or a foreach loop.  It
also can't be used to go into a construct that is optimized away.  It
can be used to go almost anywhere else within the dynamic scope,
including out of subroutines, but it's usually better to use some other
construct such as last or die.  The author of Perl has never felt the
need to use this form of goto (in Perl, that is--C is another matter).
<p>The goto-EXPR form expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved
dynamically.  This allows for computed gotos per FORTRAN, but isn't
necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:
<p>
<XMP>
    goto ("FOO", "BAR", "GLARCH")[$i];

</XMP>
<p>The goto-&amp;NAME form is highly magical, and substitutes a call to the
named subroutine for the currently running subroutine.  This is used by
AUTOLOAD subroutines that wish to load another subroutine and then
pretend that the other subroutine had been called in the first place
(except that any modifications to <STRONG>@_</STRONG> in the current subroutine are
propagated to the other subroutine.)  After the goto, not even

<A NAME="perlfunc_import_0">
import</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
There is no built-in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_import_0">import()</A>
 function.  It is merely an ordinary
method (subroutine) defined (or inherited) by modules that wish to export
names to another module.  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_3">use()</A>
 function calls the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_import_0">import()</A>
 method
for the package used.  See also

<A NAME="perlfunc_index_1">
index STR,SUBSTR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the position of the first occurrence of SUBSTR in STR at or after
POSITION.  If POSITION is omitted, starts searching from the beginning of
the string.  The return value is based at 0 (or whatever you've set the <CODE>$[</CODE>
variable to--but don't do that).  If the substring is not found, returns
one less than the base, ordinarily -1.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_int_0">
int EXPR</A>

Returns the integer portion of EXPR.  If EXPR is omitted, uses <STRONG>$_</STRONG>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_ioctl_0">
ioctl FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Implements the ioctl(2) function.  You'll probably have to say
<p>
<XMP>
    require "ioctl.ph"; # probably in /usr/local/lib/perl/ioctl.ph

</XMP>
<p>first to get the correct function definitions.  If 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_ioctl_0">ioctl.ph</A>
 doesn't
exist or doesn't have the correct definitions you'll have to roll your
own, based on your C header files such as <EM>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</EM>.
(There is a Perl script called <STRONG>h2ph</STRONG> that comes with the Perl kit which
may help you in this, but it's non-trivial.)  SCALAR will be read and/or
written depending on the FUNCTION--a pointer to the string value of SCALAR
will be passed as the third argument of the actual ioctl call.  (If SCALAR
has no string value but does have a numeric value, that value will be
passed rather than a pointer to the string value.  To guarantee this to be
TRUE, add a 0 to the scalar before using it.)  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pack_0">pack()</A>
 and 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_unpack_0">unpack()</A>

functions are useful for manipulating the values of structures used by

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_ioctl_0">ioctl()</A>
.  The following example sets the erase character to DEL.
<p>
<XMP>
    require 'ioctl.ph';
    $getp = &TIOCGETP;
    die "NO TIOCGETP" if $@ || !$getp;
    $sgttyb_t = "ccccs";                # 4 chars and a short
    if (ioctl(STDIN,$getp,$sgttyb)) {
        @ary = unpack($sgttyb_t,$sgttyb);
        $ary[2] = 127;
        $sgttyb = pack($sgttyb_t,@ary);
        ioctl(STDIN,&TIOCSETP,$sgttyb)
            || die "Can't ioctl: $!";
    }

</XMP>
<p>The return value of ioctl (and fcntl) is as follows:
<p>
<XMP>
        if OS returns:          then Perl returns:
            -1                    undefined value
             0                  string "0 but true"
        anything else               that number

</XMP>
<p>Thus Perl returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure, yet you can
still easily determine the actual value returned by the operating
system:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($retval = ioctl(...)) || ($retval = -1);
    printf "System returned %d\n", $retval;

Joins the separate strings of LIST or ARRAY into a single string with

<A NAME="perlfunc_keys_0">
keys ASSOC_ARRAY</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns a normal array consisting of all the keys of the named
associative array.  (In a scalar context, returns the number of keys.)
The keys are returned in an apparently random order, but it is the same
order as either the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_values_0">values()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>
 function produces (given that
the associative array has not been modified).  Here is yet another way
to print your environment:
<p>
<XMP>
    @keys = keys %ENV;
    @values = values %ENV;
    while ($#keys >= 0) {
        print pop(@keys), '=', pop(@values), "\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>or how about sorted by key:
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $key (sort(keys %ENV)) {
        print $key, '=', $ENV{$key}, "\n";
    }

</XMP>
<p>To sort an array by value, you'll need to use a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sort_2">sort{}</A>

function.  Here's a descending numeric sort of a hash by its values:
<p>
<XMP>
    foreach $key (sort { $hash{$b} <=> $hash{$a} } keys %hash)) {
        printf "%4d %s\n", $hash{$key}, $key;

<A NAME="perlfunc_kill_0">
kill LIST</A>

Sends a signal to a list of processes.  The first element of

processes successfully signaled.
<p>
<XMP>
    $cnt = kill 1, $child1, $child2;
    kill 9, @goners;

</XMP>
<p>Unlike in the shell, in Perl if the <EM>SIGNAL</EM> is negative, it kills
process groups instead of processes.  (On System V, a negative <EM>PROCESS</EM>
number will also kill process groups, but that's not portable.)  That
means you usually want to use positive not negative signals.  You may also
use a signal name in quotes.  See <EM>``Signals''</EM> for details.

<A NAME="perlfunc_localtime_0">
localtime EXPR</A>

Converts a time as returned by the time function to a 9-element array

<p>All array elements are numeric, and come straight out of a struct tm.
In particular this means that <STRONG>$mon</STRONG> has the range 0..11 and <STRONG>$wday</STRONG> has
the range 0..6.  If EXPR is omitted, does localtime(time).
<p>In a scalar context, prints out the ctime(3) value:

Calls the System V IPC function msgrcv to receive a message from
message queue ID into variable VAR with a maximum message size of

Interprets EXPR as an octal string and returns the corresponding

a hex string instead.)  The following will handle decimal, octal, and
hex in the standard Perl or C notation:

<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_open_1">
open FILEHANDLE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Opens the file whose filename is given by EXPR, and associates it with
FILEHANDLE.  If FILEHANDLE is an expression, its value is used as the name
of the real filehandle wanted.  If EXPR is omitted, the scalar variable of
the same name as the FILEHANDLE contains the filename.  If the filename
begins with ``&lt;'' or nothing, the file is opened for input.  If the filename
begins with ``&gt;'', the file is opened for output.  If the filename begins
with ``&gt;&gt;'', the file is opened for appending.  You can put a '+' in
front of the '&gt;' or '&lt;' to indicate that you want both read and write
access to the file; thus '+&lt;' is usually preferred for read/write
updates--the '+&gt;' mode would clobber the file first.  These correspond to
the fopen(3) modes of 'r', 'r+', 'w', 'w+', 'a', and 'a+'.
<p>If the filename begins with ``|'', the filename is interpreted
as a command to which output is to be piped, and if the filename ends with
a ``|'', the filename is interpreted See <EM>``Using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 for IPC''</EM>
for more examples of this.  as command which pipes input to us.  (You may
not have a raw 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 to a command that pipes both in <EM>and</EM> out, but see <EM>open2</EM>,
<EM>open3</EM>, and <EM>``Bidirectional Communication''</EM> for alternatives.)
<p>Opening '-' opens STDIN and opening '&gt;-' opens STDOUT.  Open returns
non-zero upon success, the undefined value otherwise.  If the open
involved a pipe, the return value happens to be the pid of the
subprocess.  
<p>If you're unfortunate enough to be running Perl on a system that
distinguishes between text files and binary files (modern operating
systems don't care), then you should check out 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_binmode_0"><EM>binmode</EM></A>
 for tips for
dealing with this.  The key distinction between systems that need binmode
and those that don't is their text file formats.  Systems like Unix and
Plan9 that delimit lines with a single character, and that encode that
character in C as '\n', do not need 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_binmode_0">binmode</A>
.  The rest need it.
<p>Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    $ARTICLE = 100;
    open ARTICLE or die "Can't find article $ARTICLE: $!\n";
    while (<ARTICLE>) {...

</XMP>

        while (<$input>) {              # note use of indirection
            if (/^#include "(.*)"/) {
                process($1, $input);
                next;

        }
    }

</PRE>
<p>You may also, in the Bourne shell tradition, specify an EXPR beginning
with ``&gt;&amp;'', in which case the rest of the string is interpreted as the
name of a filehandle (or file descriptor, if numeric) which is to be
duped and opened.  You may use &amp; after &gt;, &gt;&gt;, &lt;, +&gt;,
+&gt;&gt; and +&lt;.  The
mode you specify should match the mode of the original filehandle.
(Duping a filehandle does not take into account any existing contents of
stdio buffers.)
Here is a script that saves, redirects, and restores STDOUT and
STDERR:
<p>
<XMP>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    open(SAVEOUT, ">&STDOUT");
    open(SAVEERR, ">&STDERR");
    open(STDOUT, ">foo.out") || die "Can't redirect stdout";
    open(STDERR, ">&STDOUT") || die "Can't dup stdout";
    select(STDERR); $| = 1;     # make unbuffered
    select(STDOUT); $| = 1;     # make unbuffered
    print STDOUT "stdout 1\n";  # this works for
    print STDERR "stderr 1\n";  # subprocesses too
    close(STDOUT);
    close(STDERR);
    open(STDOUT, ">&SAVEOUT");
    open(STDERR, ">&SAVEERR");
    print STDOUT "stdout 2\n";
    print STDERR "stderr 2\n";

</XMP>
<p>If you specify ``&lt;&amp;=N'', where N is a number, then Perl will do an
equivalent of C's <EM>fdopen()</EM> of that file descriptor; this is more
parsimonious of file descriptors.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(FILEHANDLE, "<&=$fd")

</XMP>
<p>If you open a pipe on the command ``-'', i.e. either ``|-'' or ``-|'', then
there is an implicit fork done, and the return value of open is the pid
of the child within the parent process, and 0 within the child
process.  (Use 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_defined_0">defined(<STRONG>$pid</STRONG>)</A>
 to determine whether the open was successful.)
The filehandle behaves normally for the parent, but i/o to that
filehandle is piped from/to the STDOUT/STDIN of the child process.
In the child process the filehandle isn't opened--i/o happens from/to
the new STDOUT or STDIN.  Typically this is used like the normal
piped open when you want to exercise more control over just how the
pipe command gets executed, such as when you are running setuid, and
don't want to have to scan shell commands for metacharacters.  
The following pairs are more or less equivalent:
<p>
<XMP>

<p>Explicitly closing any piped filehandle causes the parent process to
wait for the child to finish, and returns the status value in <CODE>$?</CODE>.
Note: on any operation which may do a fork, unflushed buffers remain
unflushed in both processes, which means you may need to set <CODE>$|</CODE> to
avoid duplicate output.
<p>Using the FileHandle constructor from the FileHandle package,
you can generate anonymous filehandles which have the scope of whatever
variables hold references to them, and automatically close whenever
and however you leave that scope:
<p>
<XMP>
    use FileHandle;
    ...
    sub read_myfile_munged {
        my $ALL = shift;
        my $handle = new FileHandle;
        open($handle, "myfile") or die "myfile: $!";
        $first = <$handle>
            or return ();     # Automatically closed here.
        mung $first or die "mung failed";       # Or here.
        return $first, <$handle> if $ALL;       # Or here.
        $first;                                 # Or here.
    }

<p>The filename that is passed to open will have leading and trailing
whitespace deleted.  In order to open a file with arbitrary weird
characters in it, it's necessary to protect any leading and trailing
whitespace thusly:

    $file =~ s#^(\s)#./$1#;
    open(FOO, "< $file\0");

<p>If you want a ``real'' C 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open()</A>
 (see <EM>open(2)</EM> on your system), then
you should use the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_sysopen_1">sysopen()</A>
 function.  This is another way to
protect your filenames from interpretation.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    use FileHandle;
    sysopen(HANDLE, $path, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0700)
        or die "sysopen $path: $!";
    HANDLE->autoflush(1);
    HANDLE->print("stuff $$\n");
    seek(HANDLE, 0, 0);
    print "File contains: ", <HANDLE>;

<p>Each letter may optionally be followed by a number which gives a repeat
count.  With all types except ``a'', ``A'', ``b'', ``B'', ``h'' and ``H'', and ``P'' the
pack function will gobble up that many values from the LIST.  A * for the
repeat count means to use however many items are left.  The ``a'' and ``A''
types gobble just one value, but pack it as a string of length count,
padding with nulls or spaces as necessary.  (When unpacking, ``A'' strips
trailing spaces and nulls, but ``a'' does not.)  Likewise, the ``b'' and ``B''
fields pack a string that many bits long.  The ``h'' and ``H'' fields pack a
string that many nybbles long.  The ``P'' packs a pointer to a structure of
the size indicated by the length.  Real numbers (floats and doubles) are
in the native machine format only; due to the multiplicity of floating
formats around, and the lack of a standard ``network'' representation, no
facility for interchange has been made.  This means that packed floating
point data written on one machine may not be readable on another - even if
both use IEEE floating point arithmetic (as the endian-ness of the memory
representation is not part of the IEEE spec).  Note that Perl uses doubles
internally for all numeric calculation, and converting from double into
float and thence back to double again will lose precision (i.e.

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_unpack_0">unpack(``f'', pack(``f'', <STRONG>$foo</STRONG>)</A>

package NAMESPACE</A>

Declares the compilation unit as being in the given namespace.  The scope
of the package declaration is from the declaration itself through the end of
the enclosing block (the same scope as the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 operator).  All further
unqualified dynamic identifiers will be in this namespace.  A package
statement only affects dynamic variables--including those you've used

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_local_0">local()</A>
 on--but <EM>not</EM> lexical variables created with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_my_0">my()</A>
.  Typically it
would be the first declaration in a file to be included by the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_require_0">require</A>

or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_3">use</A>
 operator.  You can switch into a package in more than one place;
it merely influences which symbol table is used by the compiler for the
rest of that block.  You can refer to variables and filehandles in other
packages by prefixing the identifier with the package name and a double
colon:  <CODE><STRONG>$Package::Variable</STRONG></CODE>.  If the package name is null, the <CODE>main</CODE>
package as assumed.  That is, <CODE><STRONG>$::sail</STRONG></CODE> is equivalent to <CODE><STRONG>$main::sail</STRONG></CODE>.

Opens a pair of connected pipes like the corresponding system call.
Note that if you set up a loop of piped processes, deadlock can occur
unless you are very careful.  In addition, note that Perl's pipes use
stdio buffering, so you may need to set <CODE>$|</CODE> to flush your WRITEHANDLE

<A NAME="perlfunc_pop_0">

Pops and returns the last value of the array, shortening the array by
1.  Has a similar effect to
<p>
<XMP>
    $tmp = $ARRAY[$#ARRAY--];

</XMP>
<p>If there are no elements in the array, returns the undefined value.
If ARRAY is omitted, pops the

</STRONG>
<DD>
Prints a string or a comma-separated list of strings.  Returns TRUE
if successful.  FILEHANDLE may be a scalar variable name, in which case
the variable contains the name of or a reference to the filehandle, thus introducing one
level of indirection.  (NOTE: If FILEHANDLE is a variable and the next
token is a term, it may be misinterpreted as an operator unless you
interpose a + or put parens around the arguments.)  If FILEHANDLE is
omitted, prints by default to standard output (or to the last selected
output channel--see 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1"><EM>select</EM></A>
).  If LIST is also omitted, prints <STRONG>$_</STRONG> to
STDOUT.  To set the default output channel to something other than
STDOUT use the select operation.  Note that, because print takes a
LIST, anything in the LIST is evaluated in a list context, and any
subroutine that you call will have one or more of its expressions
evaluated in a list context.  Also be careful not to follow the print
keyword with a left parenthesis unless you want the corresponding right
parenthesis to terminate the arguments to the print--interpose a + or
put parens around all the arguments.
<p>Note that if you're storing FILEHANDLES in an array or other expression,
you will have to use a block returning its value instead:
<p>

<p>(Note: if your rand function consistently returns numbers that are too

with the wrong number of RANDBITS.  As a workaround, you can usually
multiply EXPR by the correct power of 2 to get the range you want.
This will make your script unportable, however.  It's better to recompile

<p>Note that the file will not be included twice under the same specified

end such a file with ``1;'' unless you're sure it'll return TRUE
otherwise.  But it's better just to put the ``<CODE>1;</CODE>'', in case you add more
statements.
<p>If EXPR is a bare word, the require assumes a ``<EM>.pm</EM>'' extension and
replaces ``<EM>::</EM>'' with ``<EM>/</EM>'' in the filename for you,

modules does not risk altering your namespace.

expression is interpreted as a list of single characters (hyphens
allowed for ranges).  All variables and arrays beginning with one of
those letters are reset to their pristine state.  If the expression is
omitted, one-match searches (?pattern?) are reset to match again.  Only
resets variables or searches in the current package.  Always returns
1.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    reset 'X';          # reset all X variables
    reset 'a-z';        # reset lower case variables
    reset;              # just reset ?? searches

</XMP>
<p>Resetting ``A-Z'' is not recommended since you'll wipe out your
ARGV and ENV arrays.  Only resets package variables--lexical variables
are unaffected, but they clean themselves up on scope exit anyway,
so you'll probably want to use them instead.  See

<A NAME="perlfunc_seek_0">
seek FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Randomly positions the file pointer for FILEHANDLE, just like the <EM>fseek()</EM>
call of stdio.  FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the name
of the filehandle.  The values for WHENCE are 0 to set the file pointer to
POSITION, 1 to set the it to current plus POSITION, and 2 to set it to EOF
plus offset.  You may use the values SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END for
this from POSIX module.  Returns 1 upon success, 0 otherwise.
<p>On some systems you have to do a seek whenever you switch between reading
and writing.  Amongst other things, this may have the effect of calling
stdio's clearerr(3).  A ``whence'' of 1 (SEEK_CUR) is useful for not moving
the file pointer:
<p>
<XMP>
    seek(TEST,0,1);

</XMP>
<p>This is also useful for applications emulating <CODE>tail -f</CODE>.  Once you hit
EOF on your read, and then sleep for a while, you might have to stick in a

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_seek_0">seek()</A>
 to reset things.  First the simple trick listed above to clear the
filepointer.  The 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_seek_0">seek()</A>
 doesn't change the current position, but it
<EM>does</EM> clear the end-of-file condition on the handle, so that the next
<CODE>&lt;FILE&gt;</CODE> makes Perl try again to read something.  Hopefully.
<p>If that doesn't work (some stdios are particularly cantankerous), then
you may need something more like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    for (;;) {
        for ($curpos = tell(FILE); $_ = <FILE>; $curpos = tell(FILE)) {
            # search for some stuff and put it into files
        }

Sets the current position for the

must be a value returned by

<A NAME="perlfunc_select_1">
select</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the currently selected filehandle.  Sets the current default
filehandle for output, if FILEHANDLE is supplied.  This has two
effects: first, a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_write_1">write</A>
 or a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_print_1">print</A>
 without a filehandle will
default to this FILEHANDLE.  Second, references to variables related to
output will refer to this output channel.  For example, if you have to
set the top of form format for more than one output channel, you might
do the following:
<p>
<XMP>
    select(REPORT1);
    $^ = 'report1_top';
    select(REPORT2);
    $^ = 'report2_top';

</XMP>
<p>FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the name of the
actual filehandle.  Thus:
<p>
<XMP>
    $oldfh = select(STDERR); $| = 1; select($oldfh);

</XMP>
<p>Some programmers may prefer to think of filehandles as objects with
methods, preferring to write the last example as:
<p>

    use FileHandle;
    STDERR->autoflush(1);

This calls the select(2) system call with the bitmasks specified, which

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_fileno_0">fileno()</A>

    vec($rin,fileno(STDIN),1) = 1;
    vec($win,fileno(STDOUT),1) = 1;
    $ein = $rin | $win;

</XMP>
<p>If you want to select on many filehandles you might wish to write a
subroutine:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub fhbits {
        local(@fhlist) = split(' ',$_[0]);
        local($bits);
        for (@fhlist) {

        }
        $bits;
    }
    $rin = fhbits('STDIN TTY SOCK');

</XMP>
<p>The usual idiom is:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($nfound,$timeleft) =
      select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, $timeout);

</XMP>
<p>or to block until something becomes ready just do this 
<p>
<XMP>
    $nfound = select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, undef);

</XMP>
<p>Most systems do not both to return anything useful in <STRONG>$timeleft</STRONG>, so
calling 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
 in a scalar context just returns <STRONG>$nfound</STRONG>.
<p>Any of the bitmasks can also be undef.  The timeout, if specified, is
in seconds, which may be fractional.  Note: not all implementations are
capable of returning the <STRONG>$timeleft</STRONG>.  If not, they always return
<STRONG>$timeleft</STRONG> equal to the supplied <STRONG>$timeout</STRONG>.
<p>You can effect a 250-millisecond sleep this way:

<DD>
Sorts the LIST and returns the sorted list value.  Nonexistent values
of arrays are stripped out.  If SUBNAME or BLOCK is omitted, sorts
in standard string comparison order.  If SUBNAME is specified, it
gives the name of a subroutine that returns an integer less than, equal
to, or greater than 0, depending on how the elements of the array are
to be ordered.  (The &lt;=&gt; and cmp operators are extremely useful in such
routines.)  SUBNAME may be a scalar variable name, in which case the
value provides the name of the subroutine to use.  In place of a
SUBNAME, you can provide a BLOCK as an anonymous, in-line sort
subroutine.
<p>In the interests of efficiency the normal calling code for subroutines is
bypassed, with the following effects: the subroutine may not be a
recursive subroutine, and the two elements to be compared are passed into
the subroutine not via <STRONG>@_</STRONG> but as the package global variables <STRONG>$a</STRONG> and
<STRONG>$b</STRONG> (see example below).  They are passed by reference, so don't

</STRONG>
<DD>
Splits a string into an array of strings, and returns it.
<p>If not in a list context, returns the number of fields found and splits into
the <STRONG>@_</STRONG> array.  (In a list context, you can force the split into <STRONG>@_</STRONG> by
using <CODE>??</CODE> as the pattern delimiters, but it still returns the array
value.)  The use of implicit split to <STRONG>@_</STRONG> is deprecated, however.
<p>If EXPR is omitted, splits the <STRONG>$_</STRONG> string.  If PATTERN is also omitted,
splits on whitespace (after skipping any leading whitespace).  Anything
matching PATTERN is taken to be a delimiter separating the fields.  (Note
that the delimiter may be longer than one character.)  If LIMIT is
specified and is not negative, splits into no more than that many fields
(though it may split into fewer).  If LIMIT is unspecified, trailing null
fields are stripped (which potential users of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_pop_0">pop()</A>
 would do well to
remember).  If LIMIT is negative, it is treated as if an arbitrarily large
LIMIT had been specified.
<p>A pattern matching the null string (not to be confused with
a null pattern <CODE>//</CODE>, which is just one member of the set of patterns
matching a null string) will split the value of EXPR into separate
characters at each point it matches that way.  For example:
<p>
<XMP>
    print join(':', split(/ */, 'hi there'));

</XMP>
<p>produces the output 'h:i:t:h:e:r:e'.
<p>The LIMIT parameter can be used to partially split a line
<p>
<XMP>
    ($login, $passwd, $remainder) = split(/:/, $_, 3);

</XMP>
<p>When assigning to a list, if LIMIT is omitted, Perl supplies a LIMIT
one larger than the number of variables in the list, to avoid
unnecessary work.  For the list above LIMIT would have been 4 by
default.  In time critical applications it behooves you not to split
into more fields than you really need.
<p>If the PATTERN contains parentheses, additional array elements are
created from each matching substring in the delimiter.
<p>
<XMP>
    split(/([,-])/, "1-10,20", 3);

</XMP>
<p>produces the list value
<p>
<XMP>
    (1, '-', 10, ',', 20)

</XMP>
<p>If you had the entire header of a normal Unix email message in <STRONG>$header</STRONG>, 
you could split it up into fields and their values this way:
<p>
<XMP>
    $header =~ s/\n\s+/ /g;  # fix continuation lines
    %hdrs   =  (UNIX_FROM => split /^(.*?):\s*/m, $header);

</XMP>
<p>The pattern <CODE>/PATTERN/</CODE> may be replaced with an expression to specify
patterns that vary at runtime.  (To do runtime compilation only once,
use <CODE>/<STRONG>$variable</STRONG>/o</CODE>.)
<p>As a special case, specifying a PATTERN of space (<CODE>' '</CODE>) will split on
white space just as split with no arguments does.  Thus, split(' ') can
be used to emulate <STRONG>awk</STRONG>'s default behavior, whereas 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_split_2">split(/ /)</A>

will give you as many null initial fields as there are leading spaces.
A split on /\s+/ is like a split(' ') except that any leading
whitespace produces a null first field.  A split with no arguments
really does a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_split_2">split(' ', <STRONG>$_</STRONG>)</A>
 internally.
<p>Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    open(passwd, '/etc/passwd');
    while (<passwd>) {
        ($login, $passwd, $uid, $gid, $gcos, 
            $home, $shell) = split(/:/);

    }

Returns a 13-element array giving the status info for a file, either the
file opened via FILEHANDLE, or named by EXPR.  Returns a null list if
the stat fails.  Typically used as follows:
<p>
<XMP>
    ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,
       $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)
           = stat($filename);

</XMP>
<p>Not all fields are supported on all filesystem types.  Here are the 
meaning of the fields:
<p><UL><LI>  dev	    device number of filesystem </LI>
<LI>  ino	    inode number </LI>
<LI>  mode	    file mode  (type and permissions)</LI>
<LI>  nlink	    number of (hard) links to the file </LI>
<LI>  uid	    numeric user ID of file's owner </LI>
<LI>  gid	    numer group ID of file's owner </LI>
<LI>  rdev	    the device identifier (special files only)</LI>
<LI>  size	    total size of file, in bytes </LI>
<LI>  atime	    last access time since the epoch</LI>
<LI>  mtime	    last modify time since the epoch</LI>
<LI>  ctime	    inode change time (NOT creation type!) since the epoch</LI>
<LI>  blksize   preferred blocksize for file system I/O</LI>
<LI>  blocks    actual number of blocks allocated</LI>
</UL>
<p>(The epoch was at 00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT.)
<p>If stat is passed the special filehandle consisting of an underline, no
stat is done, but the current contents of the stat structure from the
last stat or filetest are returned.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    if (-x $file && (($d) = stat(_)) && $d < 0) {
        print "$file is executable NFS file\n";
    }

<A NAME="perlfunc_study_0">
study</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Takes extra time to study SCALAR (<CODE><STRONG>$_</STRONG></CODE> if unspecified) in anticipation of
doing many pattern matches on the string before it is next modified.
This may or may not save time, depending on the nature and number of
patterns you are searching on, and on the distribution of character
frequencies in the string to be searched--you probably want to compare
runtimes with and without it to see which runs faster.  Those loops
which scan for many short constant strings (including the constant
parts of more complex patterns) will benefit most.  You may have only
one study active at a time--if you study a different scalar the first
is ``unstudied''.  (The way study works is this: a linked list of every
character in the string to be searched is made, so we know, for
example, where all the 'k' characters are.  From each search string,
the rarest character is selected, based on some static frequency tables
constructed from some C programs and English text.  Only those places
that contain this ``rarest'' character are examined.)
<p>For example, here is a loop which inserts index producing entries
before any line containing a certain pattern:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        study;
        print ".IX foo\n" if /\bfoo\b/;
        print ".IX bar\n" if /\bbar\b/;
        print ".IX blurfl\n" if /\bblurfl\b/;
        ...
        print;
    }

</XMP>
<p>In searching for /\bfoo\b/, only those locations in <STRONG>$_</STRONG> that contain ``f''
will be looked at, because ``f'' is rarer than ``o''.  In general, this is
a big win except in pathological cases.  The only question is whether
it saves you more time than it took to build the linked list in the
first place.
<p>Note that if you have to look for strings that you don't know till
runtime, you can build an entire loop as a string and eval that to
avoid recompiling all your patterns all the time.  Together with
undefining $/ to input entire files as one record, this can be very
fast, often faster than specialized programs like fgrep(1).  The following
scans a list of files (<CODE><STRONG>@files</STRONG></CODE>) for a list of words (<CODE><STRONG>@words</STRONG></CODE>), and prints
out the names of those files that contain a match:
<p>
<XMP>
    $search = 'while (<>) { study;';
    foreach $word (@words) {
        $search .= "++\$seen{\$ARGV} if /\\b$word\\b/;\n";
    }
    $search .= "}";
    @ARGV = @files;
    undef $/;
    eval $search;               # this screams
    $/ = "\n";          # put back to normal input delim
    foreach $file (sort keys(%seen)) {
        print $file, "\n";

Extracts a substring out of EXPR and returns it.  First character is at

that far from the end of the string.  If LEN is omitted, returns
everything to the end of the string.  If LEN is negative, leaves that

<p>You can use the

as an lvalue, in which case EXPR must be an lvalue.  If you assign
something shorter than LEN, the string will shrink, and if you assign

as follows: if a given argument is numeric, the argument is passed as
an int.  If not, the pointer to the string value is passed.  You are
responsible to make sure a string is pre-extended long enough to
receive any result that might be written into a string.  If your
integer arguments are not literals and have never been interpreted in a
numeric context, you may need to add 0 to them to force them to look
like numbers.

Opens the file whose filename is given by FILENAME, and associates it

the name of the real filehandle wanted.  This function calls the
underlying operating system's 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open</A>

FILENAME, MODE, PERMS.
<p>The possible values and flag bits of the MODE parameter are

However, for historical reasons, some values are universal: zero means
read-only, one means write-only, and two means read/write.
<p>If the file named by FILENAME does not exist and the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_open_1">open</A>

creates it (typically because MODE includes the O_CREAT flag), then
the value of PERMS specifies the permissions of the newly created
file.  If PERMS is omitted, the default value is 0666, which allows

<A NAME="perlfunc_umask_0">

Sets the umask for the process and returns the old one.  If EXPR is
omitted, merely returns current umask.

</STRONG>
<DD>
Undefines the value of EXPR, which must be an lvalue.  Use only on a
scalar value, an entire array, or a subroutine name (using ``&amp;'').  (Using 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_undef_0">undef()</A>

will probably not do what you expect on most predefined variables or
DBM list values, so don't do that.)  Always returns the undefined value.  You can omit
the EXPR, in which case nothing is undefined, but you still get an
undefined value that you could, for instance, return from a
subroutine.  Examples:
<p>
<XMP>
    undef $foo;
    undef $bar{'blurfl'};
    undef @ary;
    undef %assoc;
    undef &mysub;
    return (wantarray ? () : undef) if $they_blew_it;

<A NAME="perlfunc_unlink_0">
unlink LIST</A>

<DD>
Deletes a list of files.  Returns the number of files successfully
deleted.
<p>
<XMP>
    $cnt = unlink 'a', 'b', 'c';
    unlink @goners;
    unlink <*.bak>;

</XMP>
<p>Note: unlink will not delete directories unless you are superuser and
the <STRONG>-U</STRONG> flag is supplied to Perl.  Even if these conditions are
met, be warned that unlinking a directory can inflict damage on your
filesystem.  Use rmdir instead.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perlfunc_unpack_0">
unpack TEMPLATE,EXPR</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Unpack does the reverse of pack: it takes a string representing a
structure and expands it out into a list value, returning the array
value.  (In a scalar context, it merely returns the first value
produced.)  The TEMPLATE has the same format as in the pack function.
Here's a subroutine that does substring:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub substr {
        local($what,$where,$howmuch) = @_;
        unpack("x$where a$howmuch", $what);
    }

</XMP>
<p>and then there's
<p>
<XMP>
    sub ordinal { unpack("c",$_[0]); } # same as ord()

</XMP>
<p>In addition, you may prefix a field with a %&lt;number&gt; to indicate that
you want a &lt;number&gt;-bit checksum of the items instead of the items
themselves.  Default is a 16-bit checksum.  For example, the following
computes the same number as the System V sum program:
<p>
<XMP>
    while (<>) {
        $checksum += unpack("%16C*", $_);
    }
    $checksum %= 65536;

</XMP>
<p>The following efficiently counts the number of set bits in a bit vector:
<p>
<XMP>
    $setbits = unpack("%32b*", $selectmask);

<A NAME="perlfunc_untie_0">

<A NAME="perlfunc_unshift_0">

Does the opposite of a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_shift_0">shift</A>
.  Or the opposite of a 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_push_0">push</A>
,
depending on how you look at it.  Prepends list to the front of the
array, and returns the new number of elements in the array.
<p>
<XMP>
    unshift(ARGV, '-e') unless $ARGV[0] =~ /^-/;

</XMP>
<p>Note the LIST is prepended whole, not one element at a time, so the
prepended elements stay in the same order.  Use reverse to do the
reverse.

<A NAME="perlfunc_use_3">
use VERSION</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Imports some semantics into the current package from the named module,
generally by aliasing certain subroutine or variable names into your
package.  It is exactly equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    BEGIN { require Module; import Module LIST; }

</XMP>
<p>except that Module <EM>must</EM> be a bare word.
<p>If the first argument to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_3">use</A>
 is a number, it is treated as a version
number instead of a module name.  If the version of the Perl interpreter
is less than VERSION, then an error message is printed and Perl exits
immediately.  This is often useful if you need to check the current
Perl version before 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_3">use</A>
ing library modules which have changed in
incompatible ways from older versions of Perl.  (We try not to do
this more than we have to.)
<p>The BEGIN forces the require and import to happen at compile time.  The
require makes sure the module is loaded into memory if it hasn't been
yet.  The import is not a builtin--it's just an ordinary static method
call into the ``Module'' package to tell the module to import the list of
features back into the current package.  The module can implement its
import method any way it likes, though most modules just choose to
derive their import method via inheritance from the Exporter class that
is defined in the Exporter module. See <EM>Exporter</EM>.
<p>If you don't want your namespace altered, explicitly supply an empty list:
<p>
<XMP>
    use Module ();

</XMP>
<p>That is exactly equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
    BEGIN { require Module; }

</XMP>
<p>If the VERSION argument is present between Module and LIST, then the

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_3">use</A>
 will fail if the <CODE><STRONG>$VERSION</STRONG></CODE> variable in package Module is
less than VERSION.
<p>Because this is a wide-open interface, pragmas (compiler directives)
are also implemented this way.  Currently implemented pragmas are:
<p>
<XMP>
    use integer;
    use diagnostics;
    use sigtrap qw(SEGV BUS);
    use strict  qw(subs vars refs);
    use subs    qw(afunc blurfl);

</XMP>
<p>These pseudomodules import semantics into the current block scope, unlike
ordinary modules, which import symbols into the current package (which are
effective through the end of the file).
<p>There's a corresponding ``no'' command that unimports meanings imported
by use, i.e. it calls <CODE>unimport Module LIST</CODE> instead of 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_import_0">import</A>
.
<p>
<XMP>
    no integer;
    no strict 'refs';

Changes the access and modification times on each file of a list of
files.  The first two elements of the list must be the NUMERICAL access
and modification times, in that order.  Returns the number of files
successfully changed.  The inode modification time of each file is set
to the current time.  Example of a ``touch'' command:
<p>

Returns a normal array consisting of all the values of the named
associative array.  (In a scalar context, returns the number of
values.)  The values are returned in an apparently random order, but it
is the same order as either the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_keys_0">keys()</A>

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_each_0">each()</A>

<A NAME="perlfunc_vec_0">
vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Treats the string in EXPR as a vector of unsigned integers, and
returns the value of the bitfield specified by OFFSET.  BITS specifies
the number of bits that are reserved for each entry in the bit
vector. This must be a power of two from 1 to 32. 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_vec_0">vec()</A>
 may also be
assigned to, in which case parens are needed to give the expression
the correct precedence as in
<p>
<XMP>
    vec($image, $max_x * $x + $y, 8) = 3;

</XMP>
<p>Vectors created with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_vec_0">vec()</A>
 can also be manipulated with the logical
operators |, &amp; and ^, which will assume a bit vector operation is
desired when both operands are strings.
<p>To transform a bit vector into a string or array of 0's and 1's, use these:
<p>
<XMP>
    $bits = unpack("b*", $vector);
    @bits = split(//, unpack("b*", $vector));

<A NAME="perlfunc_waitpid_0">

<DD>
Waits for a particular child process to terminate and returns the pid

<p>
<XMP>
    use POSIX ":wait_h";
    ...
    waitpid(-1,&WNOHANG);

</XMP>
<p>then you can do a non-blocking wait for any process.  Non-blocking wait
is only available on machines supporting either the waitpid(2) or
wait4(2) system calls.  However, waiting for a particular pid with
FLAGS of 0 is implemented everywhere.  (Perl emulates the system call
by remembering the status values of processes that have exited but have
not been harvested by the Perl script yet.)

write</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Writes a formatted record (possibly multi-line) to the specified file,
using the format associated with that file.  By default the format for
a file is the one having the same name is the filehandle, but the
format for the current output channel (see the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select()</A>
 function) may be set
explicitly by assigning the name of the format to the <CODE>$~</CODE> variable.
<p>Top of form processing is handled automatically:  if there is
insufficient room on the current page for the formatted record, the
page is advanced by writing a form feed, a special top-of-page format
is used to format the new page header, and then the record is written.
By default the top-of-page format is the name of the filehandle with
``_TOP'' appended, but it may be dynamically set to the format of your
choice by assigning the name to the <CODE>$^</CODE> variable while the filehandle is
selected.  The number of lines remaining on the current page is in
variable <CODE>$-</CODE>, which can be set to 0 to force a new page.
<p>If FILEHANDLE is unspecified, output goes to the current default output
channel, which starts out as STDOUT but may be changed by the

<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_select_1">select</A>
 operator.  If the FILEHANDLE is an EXPR, then the expression
is evaluated and the resulting string is used to look up the name of
the FILEHANDLE at run time.  For more on formats, see the <EM>perlform</EM>  manpage
.
<p>Note that write is <EM>NOT</EM> the opposite of read.  Unfortunately.
