<A NAME="perldiag_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):
<p>
<XMP>
    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (optional).
    (S) A severe warning (mandatory).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (non-trappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).

</XMP>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <STRONG>-w</STRONG> switch.  Warnings may
be captured by setting <CODE><STRONG>$SIG</STRONG>{__WARN__}</CODE> to a reference to a routine that will be
called on each warning instead of printing it.  See the <EM>perlvar</EM>  manpage
.
Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<EM>eval</EM>.
<p>Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are denoted with a 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_s_8">%s</A>
,
just as in a printf format.  Note that some messages start with a 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_s_8">%s</A>
!
The symbols <CODE>"%-?@</CODE> sort before the letters, while <CODE>[</CODE> and <CODE>\</CODE> sort after.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>
``my'' variable 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 can't be in a package
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make sense
to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use <EM>local()</EM>
if you want to localize a package variable.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
``my'' variable 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 masks earlier declaration in same scope
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) A lexical variable has been redeclared in the same scope, effectively
eliminating all access to the previous instance.  This is almost always
a typographical error.  Note that the earlier variable will still exist
until the end of the scope or until all closure referents to it are
destroyed.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>``no'' not allowed in expression</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The ``no'' keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns
no useful value.  See the <EM>perlmod</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>``use'' not allowed in expression</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The ``use'' keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns
no useful value.  See the <EM>perlmod</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<STRONG>% </STRONG>may only be used in unpack
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You can't pack a string by supplying a checksum, since the
checksumming process loses information, and you can't go the other
way.  See <EM>unpack</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 (...) interpreted as function
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You've run afoul of the rule that says that any list operator followed
by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list operators arguments
found inside the parens.  See <EM>Terms and List Operators (Leftward)</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 argument is not a HASH element
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The argument to <EM>delete()</EM> or <EM>exists()</EM> must be a hash element, such as
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref->[12]->{"susie"}

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 did not return a true value
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a ``1;'', though any true value would
do.  See <EM>require</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 found where operator expected
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.  If it
sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an operator,
it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an operator or
delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 had compilation errors.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The final summary message when a <CODE>perl -c</CODE> fails.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 has too many errors.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 matches null string many times
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) The pattern you've specified would be an infinite loop if the
regular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.  See the <EM>perlre</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 never introduced
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of scope
before it could possibly have been used.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 syntax OK
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The final summary message when a <CODE>perl -c</CODE> succeeds.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 Command not found.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 Expression syntax.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 Undefined variable.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 not found
</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell
instead of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_p_0">
-P</A>
 not allowed for setuid/setgid script
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The script would have to be opened by the C preprocessor by name,
which provides a race condition that breaks security.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_t_0">
-T</A>
 and <CODE>-B</CODE> not implemented on filehandles
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn't
know about your kind of stdio.  You'll have to use a filename instead.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag__1">
500 Server error</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
See Server error.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag__2">
?+* follows nothing in regexp</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You started a regular expression with a quantifier.  Backslash it
if you meant it literally.   See the <EM>perlre</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<STRONG>@ </STRONG>outside of string
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You had a pack template that specified an absolute position outside
the string being unpacked.  See <EM>pack</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_accept_0">
accept()</A>
 on closed fd
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your <EM>socket()</EM> call?  See <EM>accept</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Allocation too large: <STRONG>%lx</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MSDOS machine.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_arg_0">
Arg too short for msgsnd</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) <EM>msgsnd()</EM> requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Ambiguous use of 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 resolved as 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, paren pair or declaration.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_args_0">
Args must match #! line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Argument ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' isn't numeric
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that
expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Array <STRONG>@%</STRONG>s missing the <STRONG>@ </STRONG>in argument <STRONG>%d</STRONG> of <STRONG>%<</STRONG>EM>s()</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(D) Really old Perl let you omit the <STRONG>@ </STRONG>on array names in some spots.  This
is now heavily deprecated.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
assertion botched: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Assertion failed: file ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
''
</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_assignment_0">
Assignment to both a list and a scalar</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x<STRONG>%lx</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that will
be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be outside any
of those arenas.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_attempt_1">
Attempt to free temp prematurely</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the <EM>free_tmps()</EM>
routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the SV before
the <EM>free_tmps()</EM> routine gets a chance, which means that the <EM>free_tmps()</EM>
routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free
it.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_attempt_2">
Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_attempt_3">
Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it
would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier,
and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.  This
could indicate that <EM>SvREFCNT_dec()</EM> was called too many times, or that
<EM>SvREFCNT_inc()</EM> was called too few times, or that the SV was mortalized
when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been corrupted.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_attempt_4">
Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You supplied a reference as the first argument to 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_substr_0">substr()</A>
 used
as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_substr_0"><EM>substr</EM></A>
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bad arg length for 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
, is <STRONG>%d</STRONG>, should be <STRONG>%d</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of <EM>msgctl()</EM>, <EM>semctl()</EM> or
<EM>shmctl()</EM>.  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
<STRONG>sizeof(struct msqid_ds *)</STRONG>, <STRONG>sizeof(struct semid_ds *)</STRONG> and
<STRONG>sizeof(struct shmid_ds *)</STRONG>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bad_1">
Bad associative array</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bad filehandle: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol
has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an <EM>open()</EM>, or
did it in another package.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bad <EM>free()</EM> ignored
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) An internal routine called <EM>free()</EM> on something that had never been
<EM>malloc()</EM>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <CODE>PERL_BADFREE</CODE> to 1.
<p>This message can be quite often seen with DB_File on systems with
``hard'' dynamic linking, like <CODE>AIX</CODE> and <CODE>OS/2</CODE>. It is a bug of
<CODE>Berkeley DB</CODE> which is left unnoticed if <CODE>DB</CODE> uses <EM>forgiving</EM>
system <EM>malloc()</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bad name after <STRONG>%s::</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn't
finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside of quotes,
so
<p>
<XMP>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;

</XMP>
<p>is not the same as
<p>
<XMP>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = "mypack::$var";

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bad_5">
Bad symbol for array</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bad_6">
Bad symbol for filehandle</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bad_7">
Bad symbol for hash</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_badly_0">
Badly placed ()'s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the &lt;#!&gt; line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN subroutine.
Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_bind_0">
bind()</A>
 on closed fd
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your <EM>socket()</EM> call?  See <EM>bind</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Bizarre copy of 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not copiable.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_callback_0">
Callback called exit</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via <EM>perl_call_sv()</EM>
exited by calling exit.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Can't ``last'' outside a block</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A ``last'' statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a
current block.  Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't count as a
``loopish'' block.  You can usually double the curlies to get the same
effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See <EM>last</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Can't ``next'' outside a block</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A ``next'' statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't
count as a ``loopish'' block.  You can usually double the curlies to get
the same effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See <EM>last</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Can't ``redo'' outside a block</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A ``redo'' statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't
count as a ``loopish'' block.  You can usually double the curlies to get
the same effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See <EM>last</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Can't bless non-reference value</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl ``enforces''
encapsulation of objects.  See the <EM>perlobj</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_4">
Can't break at that line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) A warning intended for while running within the debugger, indicating
the line number specified wasn't the location of a statement that could
be stopped at.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't call method ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' in empty package ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
''
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't have ANYTHING defined
in it, let alone methods.  See the <EM>perlobj</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't call method ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' on unblessed reference
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A method call must know what package it's supposed to run in.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but
you didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't
an object reference until it has been blessed.  See the <EM>perlobj</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't call method ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' without a package or object reference
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an expression that returns
neither an object reference nor a package name.  (Perhaps it's null?)
Something like this will reproduce the error:
<p>
<XMP>
    $BADREF = undef;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF->process(1,2,3);

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't chdir to 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You called <CODE>perl -x/foo/bar</CODE>, but <CODE>/foo/bar</CODE> is not a directory
that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't exist.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't coerce 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 to integer in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't
say things like:
<p>
<XMP>
    *foo += 1;

</XMP>
<p>You CAN say
<p>
<XMP>
    $foo = *foo;
    $foo += 1;

</XMP>
<p>but then <STRONG>$foo</STRONG> no longer contains a glob.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't coerce 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 to number in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't coerce 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 to string in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_12">
Can't create pipe mailbox</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The process is suffering from exhausted quotas
or other plumbing problems.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't declare 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 in my
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Only scalar, array and hash variables may be declared as lexical variables.
They must have ordinary identifiers as names.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't do inplace edit on 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_12">
%s:</A>
 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) The creation of the new file failed for the indicated reason.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_15">
Can't do inplace edit without backup</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You're on a system such as MSDOS that gets confused if you try reading
from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say <STRONG>-i</STRONG><CODE>.bak</CODE>, or some
such.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't do inplace edit: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 &gt; 14 characters
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) There isn't enough room in the filename to make a backup name for the file.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't do inplace edit: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 is not a regular file
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) You tried to use the <STRONG>-i</STRONG> switch on a special file, such as a file in
/dev, or a FIFO.  The file was ignored.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_18">
Can't do setegid!</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) The 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_setegid_0">setegid()</A>
 call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator
of suidperl.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_19">
Can't do seteuid!</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) The setuid emulator of suidperl failed for some reason.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_20">
Can't do setuid</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) This typically means that ordinary perl tried to exec suidperl to
do setuid emulation, but couldn't exec it.  It looks for a name of the
form sperl5.000 in the same directory that the perl executable resides
under the name perl5.000, typically /usr/local/bin on Unix machines.
If the file is there, check the execute permissions.  If it isn't, ask
your sysadmin why he and/or she removed it.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_21">
Can't do waitpid with flags</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) This machine doesn't have either <EM>waitpid()</EM> or <EM>wait4()</EM>, so only <EM>waitpid()</EM>
without flags is emulated.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_22">
Can't do {n,m} with n &gt; m</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Minima must be less than or equal to maxima.  If you really want
your regexp to match something 0 times, just put {0}.  See the <EM>perlre</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't emulate -
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this point.
For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a <STRONG>-x</STRONG> on the #! line.

<DD>
(W) An <EM>system()</EM>, <EM>exec()</EM> or piped open call could not execute the named
program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the permissions
were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in <CODE><STRONG>$ENV</STRONG>{PATH}</CODE>, the
executable in question was compiled for another architecture, or the
#! line in a script points to an interpreter that can't be run for
similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support #! at all.)
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't exec 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

<DD>
(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because that's
what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may need to
mention ``perl'' on the #! line somewhere.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't execute

Can't find string terminator 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means that
the closing delimiter was omitted.  Since bracketed quotes count nesting
levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:

(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_30">
Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference between
access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.  Under VMS,
access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so
that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.  Unfortunately, Perl
assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passes
it, instead of the filespec, to the access checking routine.  It will try to
retrieve the filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat buffer,
but this works only if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <EM>stat()</EM>
routine, since the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up and
returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking routine
knows about the Perl <CODE>stat</CODE> operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever
see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal
code takes stat buffers lightly.)

Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</A>

(F) The deeply magical ``goto subroutine'' call can only replace one subroutine

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_34">
Can't localize a reference</A>

<DD>
(F) You said something like <CODE>local <STRONG>$$</STRONG>ref</CODE>, which is not allowed because
the compiler can't determine whether <STRONG>$ref</STRONG> will end up pointing to anything

(F) You said to do (or require, or use) a file that couldn't be found
in any of the libraries mentioned in <STRONG>@INC</STRONG>.  Perhaps you need to set
the PERL5LIB environment variable to say where the extra library is,
or maybe the script needs to add the library name to <STRONG>@INC</STRONG>.  Or maybe
you just misspelled the name of the file.  See <EM>require</EM>.

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_58">
Can't undef active subroutine</A>

(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,

Can't use ``my 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

(F) The global variables <STRONG>$a</STRONG> and <STRONG>$b</STRONG> are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned <STRONG>$a</STRONG> or <STRONG>$b</STRONG> in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.

reference of the type needed.  You can use the <EM>ref()</EM> function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't use \1 to mean <STRONG>$1</STRONG> in expression
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that creates
a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a backreference
to a matched substring is only valid as part of a regular expression pattern.
Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a value that prints
out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the <STRONG>$1</STRONG> form instead.

Can't use an undefined value as 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to de-lurk some insidious errors.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't use global 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This is
not allowed, because the magic can only be tied to one location (namely
the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to have
variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't use subscript on 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a

didn't look like an array reference, or anything else subscriptable.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Can't write to temp file for <STRONG>-e</STRONG>: 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_can_t_72">
Can't x= to readonly value</A>

Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.

(W) A novice will sometimes say
<p>
<XMP>
    chmod 777, $filename

<p>not realizing that 777 will be interpreted as a decimal number, equivalent
to 01411.  Octal constants are introduced with a leading 0 in Perl, as in C.

<DT><STRONG>
Deep recursion on subroutine ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
''
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly) 100
times than it has returned.  This probably indicates an infinite
recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in which
case it indicates something else.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Did you mean &amp;

(W) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as <STRONG>$FOO</STRONG> or some such.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Did you mean <STRONG>$ </STRONG>or <STRONG>@ </STRONG>instead of %?
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You probably said <STRONG>%hash</STRONG>{<STRONG>$key</STRONG>} when you meant <STRONG>$hash</STRONG>{<STRONG>$key</STRONG>} or <STRONG>@hash</STRONG>{<STRONG>@keys</STRONG>}.
On the other hand, maybe you just meant <STRONG>%hash</STRONG> and got carried away.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Do you need to predeclare 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

?
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_s_8">%s</A>

found where operator expected".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
``sub'', ``package'', ``require'', or ``use'' statement.  If you're
referencing something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have
to define the subroutine or package before the current location.  You
can use an empty ``sub foo;'' or ``package FOO;'' to enter a ``forward''
declaration.

<A NAME="perldiag_elseif_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) There is no keyword ``elseif'' in Perl because Larry thinks it's
ugly.  Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method

unlikely to be what you want.

Error converting file specification 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Since Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've
passed an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a
case the conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.

(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS system

intended it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with
``+&lt;'' or ``+&gt;'' or ``+&gt;&gt;'' instead of with ``&lt;'' or nothing.  If
you only intended to write the file, use ``&gt;'' or ``&gt;&gt;''.  See

Final <STRONG>$ </STRONG>should be \<STRONG>$ </STRONG>or <STRONG>$name</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You must now decide whether the final <STRONG>$ </STRONG>in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name
that happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or
the name.
<p>

Final <STRONG>@ </STRONG>should be \<STRONG>@ </STRONG>or <STRONG>@name</STRONG>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You must now decide whether the final <STRONG>@ </STRONG>in a string was meant to be
a literal ``at'' sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name
that happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or
the name.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Format

<DD>
(W) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say

<A NAME="perldiag_gethostent_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_gethostent_0">gethostent()</A>

 operator returned an invalid UIC.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_glob_0">
Glob not terminated</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
the line, and you really meant a ``less than''.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Global symbol ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You've said ``use strict vars'', which indicates that all variables must
either be lexically scoped (using ``my''), or explicitly qualified to
say which package the global variable is in (using ``::'').

is now heavily deprecated.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Ill-formed logical name |
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) A warning peculiar to VMS.  A logical name was encountered when preparing
to iterate over <STRONG>%ENV</STRONG> which violates the syntactic rules governing logical
names.  Since it cannot be translated normally, it is skipped, and will not
appear in <STRONG>%ENV</STRONG>.  This may be a benign occurence, as some software packages
might directly modify logical name tables and introduce non-standard names,
or it may indicate that a logical name table has been corrupted.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_illegal_0">
Illegal division by zero</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in your

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_illegal_1">

<DT><STRONG>
Insecure dependency in 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or setgid,
or when you specify 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_t_0">-T</A>
 to turn it on explicitly.  The tainting mechanism
labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly from the user,
who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any such data is
used in a ``dangerous'' operation, you get this error.  See the <EM>perlsec</EM>  manpage

for more information.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Insecure directory in

(F) You can't use <EM>system()</EM>, <EM>exec()</EM>, or a piped open in a setuid or setgid
script if <CODE><STRONG>$ENV</STRONG>{PATH}</CODE> contains a directory that is writable by the world.
See the <EM>perlsec</EM>  manpage

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_insecure_2">
Insecure PATH</A>

<DD>
(F) You can't use <EM>system()</EM>, <EM>exec()</EM>, or a piped open in a setuid or
setgid script if <CODE><STRONG>$ENV</STRONG>{PATH}</CODE> is derived from data supplied (or
potentially supplied) by the user.  The script must set the path to a
known value, using trustworthy data.  See the <EM>perlsec</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_internal_0">
Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number
of times you've called <CODE>fork</CODE> and <CODE>exec</CODE>, in order to determine
whether the current call to <CODE>exec</CODE> should affect the current
script or a subprocess (see <EM>exec</EM>).  Somehow, this count
has become scrambled, so Perl is making a guess and treating
this <CODE>exec</CODE> as a request to terminate the Perl script
and execute the specified command.

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_ioctl_0">
ioctl is not implemented</A>

(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement

strange for a machine that supports C.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_junk_0">

(P) The regular expression parser is confused.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Label not found for ``last 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

(F) You named a loop to break out of, but you're not currently in a

the return value of your <EM>socket()</EM> call?  See <EM>listen</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Literal <STRONG>@%</STRONG>s now requires backslash
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) It used to be that Perl would try to guess whether you wanted an
array interpolated or a literal @.  It did this when the string was
first used at runtime.  Now strings are parsed at compile time, and
ambiguous instances of <STRONG>@ </STRONG>must be disambiguated, either by putting a
backslash to indicate a literal, or by declaring (or using) the array
within the program before the string (lexically).  (Someday it will simply
assume that an unbackslashed <STRONG>@ </STRONG>interpolates an array.)

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_misplaced_0">
Misplaced _ in number</A>

<DD>
(W) An underline in a decimal constant wasn't on a 3-digit boundary.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Missing <STRONG>$ </STRONG>on loop variable
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Apparently you've been programming in <STRONG>csh</STRONG> too much.  Variables are always
mentioned with the <STRONG>$ </STRONG>in Perl, unlike in the shells, where it can vary from
one line to the next.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Missing comma after first argument to 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) While certain functions allow you to specify a filehandle or an
``indirect object'' before the argument list, this ain't one of them.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Missing operator before 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
?
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_s_8">%s</A>

found where operator expected".  Often the missing operator is a comma.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_missing_3">
Missing right bracket</A>

<DD>
(F) The lexer counted more opening curly brackets (braces) than closing ones.
As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place you were last
editing.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_missing_4">
Missing semicolon on previous line?</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_s_8">%s</A>

found where operator expected".  Don't automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just because you saw this message.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Modification of a read-only value attempted</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant.  You didn't, of course, try ``2 = 1'', since the compiler
catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }
    mod(2);

</XMP>
<p>Another way is to assign to a 
<A HREF="perldiag.html#perldiag_substr_0">substr()</A>

<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, subscript <STRONG>%d</STRONG>
</STRONG>

(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
backwards.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, subscript ``

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_module_0">

Multidimensional syntax 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

 not supported
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) Multidimensional arrays aren't written like <CODE><STRONG>$foo</STRONG>[1,2,3]</CODE>.  They're written
like <CODE><STRONG>$foo</STRONG>[1][2][3]</CODE>, as in C.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Name ``<STRONG>%s::</STRONG>
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' used only once: possible typo
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.  If you
had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it
again somehow to suppress the message (the <CODE>use vars</CODE> pragma is
provided for just this purpose).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_negative_0">
Negative length</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer length
that is less than 0.  This is difficult to imagine.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_nested_0">
nested *?+ in regexp</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parens.  So
things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.
<p>Note, however, that the minimal matching quantifiers, *?, +? and ?? appear
to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See the <EM>perlre</EM>  manpage
.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_1">
No #! line</A>

(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
No 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

<DD>
(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or setgid
script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there will be
another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least securable.
See the <EM>perlsec</EM>  manpage

<p>
<DT><STRONG>
No <STRONG>-e</STRONG> allowed in setuid scripts

(F) A setuid script can't be specified by the user.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
No comma allowed after 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or ``indirect object'' is not
allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_5">
No command into which to pipe on command line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,
and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it doesn't know whither you
want to pipe the output from this command.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_6">
No DB::DB routine defined</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <STRONG>-d</STRONG> switch,
but for some reason the perl5db.pl file (or some facsimile thereof)
didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each
statement.  Which is odd, because the file should have been required
automatically, and should have blown up the require if it didn't parse
right.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_7">
No dbm on this machine</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, since Perl comes with SDBM.  See <EM>SDBM_File</EM>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_8">
No DBsub routine</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <STRONG>-d</STRONG> switch,
but for some reason the perl5db.pl file (or some facsimile thereof)

ordinary subroutine call.

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_9">
No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</A>

(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,

<A NAME="perldiag_no_10">
No input file after &lt; on command line</A>

from which to read data for stdin.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_11">
No output file after &gt; on command line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,
and found a lone '&gt;' at the end of the command line, so it doesn't know
whither you wanted to redirect stdout.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_12">
No output file after &gt; or &gt;&gt; on command line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,

intervening space.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_no_17">
No such pipe open</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The internal routine <EM>my_pclose()</EM> tried to
close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught earlier as
an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
No such signal: SIG

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_not_0">
Not a CODE reference</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a

(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a ``type glob'' (that is,

Possible memory corruption:

Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the
end of the buffer just in case.  This sentinel byte got clobbered, and
Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted.  See

</XMP>
<p>is now misinterpreted as
<p>
<XMP>
    open(FOO || die);

</XMP>
<p>because of the strict regularization of Perl 5's grammar into unary and
list operators.  (The old open was a little of both.) You must put
parens around the filehandle, or use the new ``or'' operator instead of ``||''.

Probable precedence problem on

(W) The compiler found a bare word where it expected a conditional,

(F) You can't use the <STRONG>-D</STRONG> option unless the code to produce the

which is why it's currently left out of your copy.

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_regexp_1">

(P) A ``can't happen'' error, because <EM>safemalloc()</EM> should have caught it earlier.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_regexp_2">
regexp too big</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses shorts as
address offsets within a string.  Unfortunately this means that if
the regular expression compiles to longer than 32767, it'll blow up.
Usually when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better
way to do it with multiple statements.  See the <EM>perlre</EM>  manpage

comes last, to avoid ambiguity with subsequent unary operators.

<A NAME="perldiag_runaway_0">
Runaway format</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Your format contained the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence, but it
produced 200 lines at once, and the 200th line looked exactly like the
199th line.  Apparently you didn't arrange for the arguments to exhaust
themselves, either by using ^ instead of @ (for scalar variables), or by
shifting or popping (for array variables).  See the <EM>perlform</EM>  manpage

Scalar value <STRONG>@%</STRONG>s[

] better written as <STRONG>$%</STRONG>s[
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
]
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a single value of
an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).
The difference is that <CODE><STRONG>$foo</STRONG>[&amp;bar]</CODE> always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while <CODE><STRONG>@foo</STRONG>[&amp;bar]</CODE> behaves
like a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to its
subscript, which can do weird things if you're only expecting one subscript.
<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, since
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See
the <EM>perlref</EM>  manpage
.

<A NAME="perldiag_script_0">

<A NAME="perldiag_semicolon_0">

Also known as ``500 Server error''.  This is a CGI error, not a Perl

the user account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment

(W) You did an <EM>exec()</EM> with some statement after it other than a <EM>die()</EM>.
This is almost always an error, because <EM>exec()</EM> never returns unless

    A keyword is misspelled.
    A semicolon is missing.
    A comma is missing.
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.
    An opening or closing brace is missing.
    A closing quote is missing.

<p>Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on <STRONG>-w</STRONG>.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, since Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<CODE>perl -c</CODE> repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of <STRONG>20 questions</STRONG>.

The function indicated isn't implemented on this architecture, according

<DT><STRONG>
The <EM>crypt()</EM> function is unimplemented due to excessive paranoia.
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) Configure couldn't find the <EM>crypt()</EM> function on your machine,
probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they

will deny it.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
The stat preceding <CODE>-l _</CODE> wasn't an lstat

(F) It makes no sense to test the current stat buffer for symbolic linkhood

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_unmatched_1">
Unmatched right bracket</A>

(F) The lexer counted more closing curly brackets (braces) than opening

last editing.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_unmatched_2">

<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Unquoted string ``

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You used a bare word that might someday be claimed as a reserved word.
It's best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize it somehow, or insert
an underbar into it.  You might also declare it as a subroutine.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Unrecognized character \<STRONG>%03o</STRONG> ignored

Unrecognized signal name ``

<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Unrecognized switch: -

(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl.  Don't do that.

supplying the bad switch on your behalf.)
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Unsuccessful 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that operation
failed, PROBABLY because the filename contained a newline, PROBABLY
because you forgot to <EM>chop()</EM> or <EM>chomp()</EM> it off.  See <EM>chop</EM>.

<DT><STRONG>
Unsupported directory function ``

Unsupported socket function ``

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_unterminated_0">
Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</A>

<DD>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not

the line, and you really meant a ``less than''.

<A NAME="perldiag_use_2">
Use of $* is deprecated</A>

(D) This variable magically turned on multiline pattern matching, both for

action-at-a-distance effects of <CODE>$*</CODE>.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Use of 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible only
from C.  This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Use of 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(D) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use, generally

bad side effects.

<DT><STRONG>
<EM>Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean &lt;&lt;``'' is deprecated</EM>

<DD>
(D) You are now encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if you
wish to use a blank line as the terminator of the here-document.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Use of implicit split to <STRONG>@_</STRONG> is deprecated
</STRONG>
<DD>
(D) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber a
subroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results of
a <EM>split()</EM> explicitly to an array (or list).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="perldiag_use_7">
Use of uninitialized value</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) An undefined value was used as if it were already defined.  It was
interpreted as a ``'' or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.  To suppress this
warning assign an initial value to your variables.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Useless use of 
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
 in void context
</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothing
with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a value
from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very often
this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse
your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd get this
if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said
<p>
<XMP>
    $one, $two = 1, 2;

</XMP>
<p>when you meant to say
<p>
<XMP>
    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);

</XMP>
<p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say
<p>
<XMP>
    $array = (1,2);

</XMP>
<p>when you should have said
<p>
<XMP>
    $array = [1,2];

</XMP>
<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
the <EM>perlref</EM>  manpage
 for more on this.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
Variable ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">
%s</A>
'' is not exported
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) While ``use strict'' in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported
by that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character
on the front of your variable.

Warning: unable to close filehandle

<DD>
(S) The implicit <EM>close()</EM> done by an <EM>open()</EM> got an error indication on the

<DT><STRONG>
Warning: Use of ``

'' without parens is ambiguous
</STRONG>
<DD>
(S) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that looks like a
binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a term or
unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand function
has a default argument of 1.0, and you write
<p>
<XMP>
    rand + 5;

</XMP>
<p>you may THINK you wrote the same thing as
<p>
<XMP>
    rand() + 5;

</XMP>
<p>but in actual fact, you got
<p>
<XMP>
    rand(+5);

Use a filename instead.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) And you probably never will, since you probably don't have the

about what you want.  Your best bet is to use the wrapsuid script in
the eg directory to put a setuid C wrapper around your script.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
You need to quote ``
<A NAME="perldiag_s_8">

</STRONG>
<DD>
(W) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.  Unfortunately, you
already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means that Perl 5
will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is executed, which is
probably not what you want.  (If it IS what you want, put an &amp; in front.)

(W) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.  The use
of backslashes is grandfathered on the righthand side of a

<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and
found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect STDIN using
'&lt;'.  Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.

'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and
thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to another
command.  You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's stopping you
from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits' output into two
streams, such as
<p>
<XMP>
    open(OUT,">$ARGV[0]") or die "Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!";
    while (<STDIN>) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;

(P) An error peculiar to OS/2. Most probably you use an obsolete version
of perl, and should not happen anyway.

Malformed PERLLIB_PREFIX</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to OS/2. PERLLIB_PREFIX should be of the form
<p>
<XMP>
    prefix1;prefix2

</XMP>
<p>or
<p>
<XMP>
    prefix1 prefix2

</XMP>
<p>with non-empty prefix1 and prefix2. If <CODE>prefix1</CODE> is indeed a prefix of 
a builtin library search path, prefix2 is substituted. The error may appear
if components are not found, or are too long. See <EM>``PERLLIB_PREFIX''</EM>.

<A NAME="perldiag_perl_sh_dir_0">

(W) This is a standard message issued by OS/2 applications, while *nix
applications die in silence. It is considered a feature of the OS/2
