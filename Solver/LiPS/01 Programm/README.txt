Linear Program Solver (LiPS) is an optimization package intended for solving linear, integer and goal programming problems. The main features of the LiPS are:

 LiPS solver is based on the efficient implementation of the modified simplex method; 
 LiPS provides not only an answer, but a detailed solution process as a sequence of simplex tables, so you can use it in studying (teaching) linear programming. 
 LiPS provides the procedures of sensitivity analysis, which enable us to study the behavior of the model when you change its parameters, including: analysis of changes in the right sides of constraints, analysis of changes in the coefficients of the objective function, the analysis of changes in the column / row of the technology matrix. Such information may be extremely useful in the practical application of LP models. 
 LiPS provides the methods of the goal programming, including the lexicographic and weighted GP methods. Goal programming methods are intended for solving multi-objective optimization problems.
